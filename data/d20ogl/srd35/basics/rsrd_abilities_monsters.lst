# Original Entry by: Tir Gwaith

# Fear Aura, Fear Cone, Fear Ray have different effects, so I've left them off for now.  Probably best done by individual monster.
# Frightful Presense has many variants....  Just putting the DC in for now.
# Same with Gaze.  Just listing it as a Gaze attack for now.
# Paralysis doesn't give a standard formula for Fort DC, so I'm leaving off until such time as we can develop a standard method.
