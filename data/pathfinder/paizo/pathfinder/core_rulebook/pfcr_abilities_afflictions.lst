###Block: Temp Bonuses
Inspire Courage		CATEGORY:Internal	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT,DAMAGE|InspireCourageBonus|TYPE=Competence|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:VAR|ActivateTempBonus|1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	BONUS:VAR|InspireCourageBonus|%CHOICE|PREAPPLY:ANYPC	CHOOSE:NUMBER|MIN=1|MAX=4|TITLE=Bonus Number Applied		TEMPDESC:Inspire courage: +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls, goes up at 5th and every six levels after that.
#I don't think inspire competence is needed, it's just one bonus to a skill but a competence bonus. (he ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard's performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).)
Inspire Greatness		CATEGORY:Internal	TEMPDESC:Inspire Greatness: A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.

Aura of Justice		CATEGORY:Internal	TEMPDESC:Aura of Justice is probably not possible (depends on the Paladin level): At 11th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability.		BONUS:VAR|ActivateTempBonus,AuraOfJusticeActivate|1|PREAPPLY:ANYPC
