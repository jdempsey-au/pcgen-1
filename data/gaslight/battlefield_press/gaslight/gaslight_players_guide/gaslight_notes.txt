#CLASS FILE
Updated class casting progression to handle 30 levels.
Updated divine casting progression.
Acolyte - used formulas where possible
Apprentice - used formulas where possible
ALL - removed "APPLIEDAS=EPIC" as Epic progression not used.

#SKILL FILE:
Changed to Allow altering of max ranks: Set up DISPLAY Skill and Regular Skill
NOTE: CHOOSE w/ Skill and MAX rank will not work as MAX RANK is 10 higher for support. Need to use another QUALIFIER that will respect the PREVAR instead.


#COMPANIONMOD FILE
Take advantage of the new feat mastervar and condense the file space, move familiar items into ability where possible
Add new masterbonus - fly is erroneous, but Jon has not substitute.

#Familiars - 

# GAMEMODE FILES
Changed XP progressions to use Slow, Medium and Fast
Added VAR 'MaxRank' for CLASS SKILL Max Rank system. Set to 10 above normal, should be more than sufficient. Leaves a pontential for +8 more.


# ISSUES DISCOVERED
Fly - Skill does not exist - referenced as a +3 Bonus by Familiar to Master Bonus (Race is BAT)
No Familiars are listed in the book. References Familiars from outside sources (Greensting Scorpion...)
Knowledge (Psychic) & Knowledge (Technology) listed separately from the Knowledge group.

OS Updates required:
Max Rank needs to use PCVAR Max_Rank_Display if available, fall back to default if not present.
