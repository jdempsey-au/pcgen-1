		<p> The Race tab is where you select your race (you can only have 1!), and where 
		  you can pick any templates that apply to your character. It is divided into 
		  two sub-tabs: Races and Templates.</p>
		
		<p> Sort Races (Drop Down Menu) - There are 3 ways you can categorize the Races:</p> 

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - No hierarchy</li>

			<li><strong>Type</strong> - The Types of races are the top-level, with races of that type 
			being listed in it)</li>

			<li><strong>Source</strong> - as in books that were loaded in the Source Material tab</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Selected Race</strong> (Information Reporting) - This indicates what Race you've selected. It will 
		display &lt;none selected&gt; if no race has been selected.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Select</strong> (Button) - To select a race, you can double-click on it, or you can click on it and 
		then click on the Select button.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Upper Left Frame</strong> (Tree Window) - This table lists the available races.;</p>
		
		<ul>
			
		    <li> You can filter what races are listed by clicking on the filter icon (the 
			magnifying glass icon in the toolbar) or by typing text into the Filter field.</li>

			<li>The table will display various attributes of the races</li>

			<li>You can sort by those columns by clicking on the column header.</li>

			<li>Races which you don't qualify for will be shaded with the pre-requisite failure color (default is red).</li>

			<li>In the Pre-Reqs column the pre-requisites for the race (if any) will be listed, with any pre-reqs that 
			you don't meet being shown in the pre-requisites failure color.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong> Race Info Frame</strong> (Information Reporting) - This displays the details of the race you last 
		clicked on.</p>
