		<h1>Main Tab: Spells</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/spells_known.png" alt="Main Tab: Spells" /></p>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Spells </strong>tab where the user can add spells to the PC is the PC is able to cast spells.</p>
		
		<p>The upper table is where you can select which <strong>Class</strong>, and <strong>Level </strong>you wish to be displayed in
		the spells tables below.</p>
		
		<p>All spell casters start with a <strong>Known Spells</strong> spell book - in this book are all the spells the 
		caster knows.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Wizards can put an unlimited number of spells in their Known Spells book</li>
			<li>Sorcerers and the like can only add a finite amount</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Spell casters, which can memorize spells, can type in a name in the <strong>Book
		Named</strong> field and then:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Use the <strong>Add</strong> button to add a new book to the right hand top pane</li>
			<li>Use the <strong>Del</strong> button to remove that book from the right hand top pane</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If the <strong>Known Spells</strong> book is selected, the <strong>Class Info</strong> (bottom right pane) table lists all the
		available spells to be known for that class of that level.</p>
		
		<p>Any spells which the character knows of that level will then be displayed in the <strong>Spell Info</strong> (bottom left) 
		table - each spell can only be known once so putting them in multiple times will not work</p>
		
		<p>Some classes (mostly Divine) know all spells automatically so the <strong>Selected</strong> table will match the 
		<strong>Available</strong> table.</p>
		
		<p>Only spell casters that memorize spells can choose a book other than <strong>Known
		Spells</strong>, and if a different book is selected the <strong>Available</strong> table
		lists all known spells and the <strong>Selected</strong> table lists all memorized spells
		for this book. In this case it is possible to memorize spells more than once.</p>
		
		<p>Typical uses of this are for creating a book named
		&quot;Underground&quot; to hold which spells used when in a dungeon-crawl, or a
		book named &quot;In Town&quot; to indicate which spells used when in a town
		adventure.</p>
