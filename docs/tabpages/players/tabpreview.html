		<h1>Preview Tab</h1>
		
		
<p>The Preview Tab displays all characters loaded in PCGen in a format similar 
  to the output sheets PCGen exports to. Changes made to the character in PCGen 
  are updated automatically in the Preview Tab at the time you make them. So, 
  for example, if you were to apply the Rage bonuses from the Temporary Bonus 
  Tab you would see these changes applied to your character when you returned 
  to the Preview Tab.</p>

		<p>The tabs on the left allow you to navigate through the pages of the character 
		sheet. Page contains the primary information such as name, ability scores, skills, 
  		hit points, etc.. Page 2 contains additional information such as Feats and Special 
  		Abilities. If your character is a spellcaster there will be additional pages 
  		displaying your spells. If multiple characters are loaded the names of the characters 
  		will appear on tabs at the bottom of the character sheet allowing you to switch 
  		between characters.</p>
