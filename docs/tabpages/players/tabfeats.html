		<h1>Main Tab: Feats</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/feats.png" alt="Main Tab: Feats" /></p>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Feats</strong> tab. Here the user will choose which feats and other abilities, 
		loaded from the sources, to add to the character.</p>
		
		<p>As of version 5.12 the Feats Tab has sub-tabs to support multiple feat-like abilities. 
		By default the Feats sub-tab will always be first. Additional sub-tabs other other categories of abilities may be present. 
		Currently only the RSRD's Divine Salient Abilities and the MSRD's Mutations are using this new feature. 
		Expect to see much more development in future versions, this is the planned place for displaying and choosing Class Features, 
		Racial Traits, Special Qualities and Special Attacks as well as other, more exotic features used in other datasets.</p>
		
		<p>The number in the upper-left contains the list of Feats (or Abilities) to be chosen.</p>
		
		<p>Next to the word &quot;Available&quot; is a selection box that lets the user pick
		which &quot;view&quot; to use. It is this view, which will be used to determine
		the structure of the table below it. The same is true for the
		&quot;Selected&quot; feats, which list the feats already selected for the PC.</p>
		
		<p>By default the feats for the PC'selected as optional feats are in black text in
		the Selected table. Feats and Abilities gained <strong>automatically</strong> (due to a race or class
		property) are displayed in dark-yellow text. Feats and Abilities gained <strong>virtually</strong>
		(typically this means there's some restriction on them) are displayed in
		magenta text. Virtual or Automatic Feats and Abilities cannot be removed or changed the
		selections of <strong>Virtual</strong> or <strong>Futomatic Feats and Abilities</strong>. By clicking on the <strong>Filter
		icons</strong> in the toolbar (the icons with the magnifying glass.)</p>
		
		<p>To add an item, double-clicking on it, right clicking on it or clicking on it and
		the on the right-arrow button. Similarly to <strong>remove feats</strong>, or alter the
		selections of optional feats which have choices, by double-clicking on it in
		the &quot;Selected&quot; table, or by right-clicking on it there, or by
		selecting it and then clicking on the left-arrow button above the table. As
		elsewhere in PCGen anything that is not qualified for is in red italics.</p>
		
		<p>The info-pane in the bottom-left will provide details about any feat clicked upon -
		including any pre-requisites and its source.</p>
