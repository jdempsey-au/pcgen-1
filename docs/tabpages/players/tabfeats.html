		<h1>Main Tab: Feats</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/feats.png" alt="Main Tab: Feats" /></p>
		
		<p>This is the <strong>Feats</strong> tab. Here the user will choose which feats, loaded from the
		sources, to add to the character.</p>
		
		<p>The number in the upper-left contains the list of &#8216;Feats Remaining&#8217; to be chosen.</p>
		
		<p>Next to the word &quot;Available&quot; is a selection box that lets the user pick
		which &quot;view&quot; to use. It is this view, which will be used to determine
		the structure of the table below it. The same is true for the
		&quot;Selected&quot; feats, which list the feats already selected for the PC.</p>
		
		<p>By default the feats for the PC'selected as optional feats are in black text in
		the Selected table. Feats gained <strong>automatically</strong> (due to a race or class
		property) are displayed in dark-yellow text. Feats gained <strong>virtually</strong>
		(typically this means there's some restriction on them) are displayed in
		magenta text. Virtual or automatic feats cannot be removed or changed the
		selections of <strong>virtual</strong> or <strong>automatic feats</strong>. By clicking on the <strong>Filter
		icons</strong> in the toolbar (the icons with the magnifying glass.)</p>
		
		<p>To add a feat by double-clicking on it, right clicking on it or clicking on it and
		the on the right-arrow button. Similarly to <strong>remove feats</strong>, or alter the
		selections of optional feats which have choices, by double-clicking on it in
		the &quot;Selected&quot; table, or by right-clicking on it there, or by
		selecting it and then clicking on the left-arrow button above the table. As
		elsewhere in PCGen anything that is not qualified for is in red italics.</p>
		
		<p>The info-pane in the bottom-left will provide details about any feat clicked upon -
		including any pre-requisites and its source.</p>
