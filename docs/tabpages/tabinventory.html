		<h1>Inventory Tab</h1>
		
		<p>The Inventory tab is where you purchase &amp; equip items that your character possesses. It is made up of two sub-tabs: </p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="#purchase">Purchase</a></strong> - Purchasing and selling equipment</li>
			<li><strong><a href="#equipment">Equipment</a></strong> - Organizing the items you own into equipment sets. Determining which weapons and armor are 
				used and in what hands</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="purchase">Purchase Sub-Tab</a></h2>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_purchase.png" alt="Inventory Purchase Sub-Tab" /></p>
		
		<p>This sub-tab allows the purchasing and selling of armor, items, shields and weapons.</p>
		<p>The left pane includes items that can be bought or customized. The "Available" drop-down menu lets you choose how to list the items.</p>
		<p>The right pane includes the items your character currently has.  If you right-click any of the items there you will get the option to "Move To" and "Copy To". Under each option there is a listing of all the other currently-loaded characters. You can then either move the item (sending the selected item to the selected character and removing it from the current character's list of equipment) or copy it (send a copy of the item to the selected character).</p>
		<p>The "Order" column dictates the order the items get output to the character output sheet (only equipped items get output to the output sheets).</p>
		
		<p>Items can be purchased by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Selecting the item in the left frame and then clicking the &quot;&gt;&quot; (Add)
			  button</li>
			<li>Selecting the item in the left frame and then pressing <strong>Ctrl&gt;&lt;=&gt;</strong></li>
			<li>Double Clicking the item in the left frame</li>
			<li>Right clicking the item in the left frame and buying 1, 5, 10, 20 or n (user entered quantity) at a time</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>As you purchase items you will see the amount of money you have available in the lower right frame diminishes.
		The amount deducted is the price multiplied by the <strong>Buy Percentage</strong></p>
		
		<p>Items can be sold by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Selecting the item in the right frame and then clicking the &quot;&lt;&quot; (Remove)
			  button</li>
			<li>Selecting the item in the right frame and then pressing <strong>Ctrl&gt;&lt;-&gt;</strong></li>
			<li>Double Clicking the item in the right frame</li>
			<li>Right clicking the item in the right frame and selling 1, 5, 10, 20 or n (user entered quantity) at a time</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>As you sell items you will see the amount of money you have available in the lower right frame increases.
		The amount added is the price multiplied by the <strong>Sell Percentage</strong></p>
		
		<p>You can modify this total by editing the <strong>Gold:</strong> field.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Allow Debt</strong> option enables PCGen to allow negative gold amounts to represent what the Character owes.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ignore Cost</strong> option allows items to be added or removed without effecting the gold value.</p>
		
		<p>Pressing <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;f&gt;</strong> or using the right click menu's <strong>Find
		item</strong> option allows for searching for items. The nearest match in the item list will be highlighted.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/windows/find_item.png" alt="Item Search" /></p>
		
		<p>The charges a wand or similar item has left can be modified after purchasing the item by right clicking it in 
		the right window and choosing <strong>Modify Charges</strong>.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_modifycharges.png" alt="Modify Charges" /></p>
		
		
		<h3>Creating Masterwork/Magical/Sizing Items</h3>
		
		<p>To make an item Masterwork, Magical or change its properties (like take a
		regular set of plate mail and make it small-sized for a small sized PC), right
		click on it and choose <strong>Create custom item</strong>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The item needs to be &quot;Masterwork&quot; if a magical item is to be created.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_customizer.png" alt="Item Customizer" /></p>
		
		<p>To add new properties to the item, select them from the left hand pane and
		either double click or click the <strong>Add</strong> button. If the Property
		prerequisites are not met, it is shown in the default error color and it cannot
		be added. </p>
		
		<p>Other than properties, the following can be modified:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name that will be displayed in the item list</li>
			<li><strong>Sprop</strong> - Any special properties that the item has</li>
			<li><strong>Cost</strong> - The purchase cost of the item</li>
			<li><strong>Weight</strong> - The weight of the item</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once all properties have been selected, you can either choose <strong>OK</strong> to add it to the item list or <strong>Buy</strong> 
		to add it to the item list and add it to the characters possessions</p>

		<h2><a name="equipment">Equipment Sub-Tab</a></h2>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipment.png" alt="Inventory Equipping Sub-Tab" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Equipment</strong> sub-tab helps you organize the gear your character owns as well as determining which weapons and armor 
			are used and in what hands. This sub-tab allows the gear that was purchased to be equipped to the character. The pane on the upper-left 
			contains the items that your character has purchased and the right pane shows the equipment that has been &quot;equipped&quot; as well 
			as the location to which the gear has been equipped. You equip gear by selecting an item from the left hand frame and double clicking 
			on it or clicking on the <strong>Equip Selected ;&gt;</strong> button at the bottom right of the pane.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipment.png" alt="Equipping Gear" /></p>
		
		<p>This Sub-tab allows the Gear that was purchased to be equipped to the character.</p>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipsets.png" alt="Equipment Sets" /></p>
		
		<p>It also allows the creation of multiple equipment sets so you can print output sheets based on different weapon, 
			armor and item combinations for your character.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipedpane.png" alt="Equiped Pane" /></p>

		<p>Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper right frame. Some items are automatically &quot;Equipped&quot; 
			to the appropriate locations, e.g. Armor, Shields, and magical items, if the locations are not already filled. Equipping all 
			items to the appropriate location ensures that PCGen will give the appropriate benefit for using the items. Additionally, 
			every item your character is carrying should be marked as &quot;Carried&quot; so your character's encumbrance will be 
			figured correctly.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_equipselection.png" alt="Equip Selection" /></p>

		<p>Weapons can be equipped as Single Handed, Two Handed and Both Hands. The equipped style determines what bonuses/penalties 
		apply. Weapons that are carried will appear on the character sheet in the weapons section.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_01_container.png" alt="Equipping to a Container" /></p>
		
		<p>Some items are containers and can hold other items. This can be done by &quot;equipping&quot; the items to the containers 
			directly.</p>

		<p>Every item your character is carrying should be marked &quot;Carried&quot; so your encumbrance will be figured correctly. 
			You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of an equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right hand frame).</p>
