	<h1>Creating Your First Character</h1>

	<p>Creating a new character is easy using PCGen. The steps below will guide you through the process. As you walk your way through this 
		guide you will note that it does not cover all buttons and fields you see on the various tabs. What we will cover here is what is 
		necessary to create your first character.</p>

	<h2>The Basics</h2>

	<ol>

		<li><strong>Opening Up a New Character</strong>

			<p>Choose the <strong>File&gt;New</strong> menu item to create a new character. You may also use the &quot;New&quot; 
				<img src="../images/toolbar/new16.png" alt="New Character"> toolbar button just below the menu bar.</p>
			
			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_00_file_new.png" alt="File Menu"></p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Starting With the Summary Tab</strong>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_01_summary.png" alt="Summary Tab"></p>
			
			<p>A quick review of this tab shows the following areas containing related information: <strong>Character Basics</strong>, 
				<strong>Ability Scores</strong>, <strong>Race</strong>, <strong>Class &amp; Level</strong>, and <strong>Things to Do</strong> 
				areas all contain fields for entering various data, some more related than others. The first thing we need to do though is 
				to take a quick look at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. Note this area and what it currently contains. We'll come 
				back in a bit.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Entering Ability Scores</strong>

			<p>The first things we're going to do is enter the new character's ability scores, and there are a couple of ways to do this.</p>

			<p>The first, and the quickest way to get you started right now is to simply enter the ability scopres directly into the avaiable 
				fields, which are editable. Click inside each field in turn and, deleting the existing number, type the new ability score.</p>

			<p>The second way to enter ability scores into PCGen is to have PCGen generate them for you. To do this you first have to set the 
				roll method by clicking the <strong>Method</strong> button and selcting which method you wish to use. Then you will click the 
				<strong>Roll</strong> button. You can click the roll button as often as you desire until you get a set of numbers that you like.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Choosing Your Character's Name</strong>

			<p>Next we'll enter a name for your new character and, as with ability scores, there are two ways to enter a name.</p>

			<p>The first, and, again as with ability scores, the method we will use here is to simply enter the new characr's name directly 
				into the <strong>Name</strong> field. Click on the field and enter your character's name.</p>

			<p>The second method of adding a name is to use PCGen's random name generator.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_02_name.png" alt="Random Name Generator"></p>
			
			<p>Before we call up the random name generator you will need to make sure the <strong>Gender</strong> pull-down menu correctly identifies 
				your character's gender. Once that is done you will click on the <strong>Random</strong> button next to the name field.</p>

			<p>Once the name generator window is up you select the <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Catalog</strong> from which the name will 
				be drawn and then click the <strong>Generate</strong> button. A name will appear in the generator's <strong>Name</strong> field. If 
				you do not like the name that cmes up simply click the <strong>Generate</strong> button until one shows up that you like and then 
				click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

			<p>PCGen's random name generator has a good selection of names, of both fantasy and historical origin.</p>

			<p>Once you've entered a character name you might as well enter names into the <strong>Player</strong> and <strong>Tab Label</strong> fields. 
				The tab label is used if you wish the tab for your character to be designated with something other than your character's name.</p>

			<p>Before we move to the next step take a look at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. . . . Did you notice that &quot;Enter a Name&quot; 
				is now missing? This is one of the most useful blocks of information on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> when creating a character.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Selecting a Race</strong>

		<p>Now we move to selecting a race.</p>

		<p>The quickest way to select a race is to do so from the <strong>Race</strong> pull-down menu on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong>. The races 
			on this menu are listed with the <strong>PC</strong> races first to simplify your selection. To select a race you pull-down to the desired 
			race and let go of the menu. The race will automatically be selected after clicking in any other data field. upon triggering the selection 
			any racial bonuses to the ability scores will automatically be added.</p>

		<p>There is, of course, another way to select a race and this is on the <strong>Race Tab</strong>.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Looking at the Race Tab</strong>

		<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_03_race.png" alt="Selecting a Race"></p>

		<p></p>

		</li>


		<li><strong>Back to the Summary Tab and Selecting a Class</strong>
