	<h1>Creating Your First Character</h1>

	<p>Creating a new character is easy using PCGen. The steps below will guide you through the process. As you walk your way through this 
		guide you will note that it does not cover all buttons and fields you see on the various tabs. What we will cover here is what is 
		necessary to create your first character. For the purposes of this walkthrough we will be using the <strong>Pathfinder</strong> 
		GameMode. Using a different gameMode will present different tabs and sub-tabs as well as specific game options. Following along 
		with this walkthrough though will help you understand the basic interface and help you to find your way through any other gamemode.</p>

	<h2>The Basics</h2>

	<ol>

		<li><strong>Opening Up a New Character</strong>

			<p>Choose the <strong>File&gt;New</strong> menu item to create a new character. You may also use the &quot;New&quot; 
				<img src="../images/toolbar/new16.png" alt="New Character"> toolbar button just below the menu bar.</p>
			
			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_00_file_new.png" alt="File Menu"></p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Starting With the Summary Tab</strong>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_01_summary.png" alt="Summary Tab"></p>
			
			<p>A quick review of this tab shows the following areas containing related information: <strong>Character Basics</strong>, 
				<strong>Ability Scores</strong>, <strong>Race</strong>, <strong>Class &amp; Level</strong>, and <strong>Things to Do</strong> 
				areas all contain fields for entering various data, some more related than others. The first thing we need to do though is 
				to take a quick look at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. Note this area and what it currently contains. We'll come 
				back in a bit.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Entering Ability Scores</strong>

			<p>The first things we're going to do is enter the new character's ability scores, and there are a couple of ways to do this.</p>

			<p>The first, and the quickest way to get you started right now is to simply enter the ability scopres directly into the avaiable 
				fields, which are editable. Click inside each field in turn and, deleting the existing number, type the new ability score.</p>

			<p>The second way to enter ability scores into PCGen is to have PCGen generate them for you. To do this you first have to set the 
				roll method by clicking the <strong>Method</strong> button and selcting which method you wish to use. Then you will click the 
				<strong>Roll</strong> button. You can click the roll button as often as you desire until you get a set of numbers that you like.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Choosing Your Character's Name</strong>

			<p>Next we'll enter a name for your new character and, as with ability scores, there are two ways to enter a name.</p>

			<p>The first, and, again as with ability scores, the method we will use here is to simply enter the new characr's name directly 
				into the <strong>Name</strong> field. Click on the field and enter your character's name.</p>

			<p>The second method of adding a name is to use PCGen's random name generator.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_02_name.png" alt="Random Name Generator"></p>
			
			<p>Before we call up the random name generator you will need to make sure the <strong>Gender</strong> pull-down menu correctly identifies 
				your character's gender. Once that is done you will click on the <strong>Random</strong> button next to the name field.</p>

			<p>Once the name generator window is up you select the <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Catalog</strong> from which the name will 
				be drawn and then click the <strong>Generate</strong> button. A name will appear in the generator's <strong>Name</strong> field. If 
				you do not like the name that cmes up simply click the <strong>Generate</strong> button until one shows up that you like and then 
				click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

			<p>PCGen's random name generator has a good selection of names, of both fantasy and historical origin.</p>

			<p>Once you've entered a character name you might as well enter names into the <strong>Player</strong> and <strong>Tab Label</strong> fields. 
				The tab label is used if you wish the tab for your character to be designated with something other than your character's name.</p>

			<p>Before we move to the next step take a look at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. . . . Did you notice that &quot;Enter a Name&quot; 
				is now missing? This is one of the most useful blocks of information on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> when creating a character.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Selecting a Race</strong>

			<p>Now we move to selecting a race.</p>

			<p>The quickest way to select a race is to do so from the <strong>Race</strong> pull-down menu on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong>. The races 
				on this menu are listed with the <strong>PC</strong> races first to simplify your selection. To select a race you pull-down to the desired 
				race and let go of the menu. The race will automatically be selected after clicking in any other data field. upon triggering the selection 
				any racial bonuses to the ability scores will automatically be added.</p>

			<p>There is, of course, another way to select a race and this is on the <strong>Race Tab</strong>.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Selecting a Race, The Race Tab</strong>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_03_race.png" alt="Selecting a Race"></p>

			<p>Selecting a race on the <strong>Race Tab</strong> is a little more difficult than the quick method but is still fairly simple. 
				The left pane lists all races contained in the currently loaded data sets and if the data sets include bestiaries this list 
				can get very long. Its fortunate then that the <strong>Race Tab</strong> has, as most of tabs, a <strong>Search</strong> function.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_04_search.png" alt="Searching for a Race"></p>

			<p>Enter the name of the race you are interested in. Note that as you type the name in the list of races begins to change. PCGen 
				does its search actively as you type, saving time for you, the user. Once the character race that you are looking for appears 
				you click on the <strong>Select Race &gt;</strong> button and the selected race will be placed in the right pane.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Back to the Summary Tab and Selecting Bonus Languages</strong>

			<p>Moving back to the <strong>Summary Tab</strong>, take a look at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. If your new character 
				has a high enough intelligence you will see the message &quo;Select Bonus Languages&quot;. If not, feel free to jump to the 
				next step.</p>

			<p>Just above the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane you wll find the <strong>Languages</strong> pane. Click on the &quot;Add Bonus 
				Language&quot; <strong>+</strong> button.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_05_language.png" alt="Selecting a Bonus Language"></p>

			<p>You can find how many bonus language slots you have available by looking above the right pane. To select a bonus language you 
				click on the desired language in the left pane and then click on the <strong>Add Language &gt;</strong> button. This will move 
				the selected language to the right pane and reduce the avialable language slots by one.</p>

			<p>Repeat this process until you are out of bonus language slots.</p>

			<p>Its time to once again take a look and see what's next on our list of <strong>Things to Do</strong>.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Selecting a Class</strong>

			<p>Now, at last, its time to select your new characters Class!</p>

			<p>As with race selection, there are two ways to select a class. We will start with the quick method.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_06_class.png" alt="Available Classes"></p>

			<p>Clicking on the <strong>Class</strong> drop-down menu in the <strong>Class &amp; Level</strong> section of the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> 
				presents a list of available classes. Scroll through the list and select the desired class. You will note that some of these classes 
				appear in red text. This is an indication that the classes have inherent prerequisites that your new character does not meet. If the 
				restricted class is a base PC class it will likely have an alignment requirement so if you have not selected an alignment yet you can 
				do so at this time by clicking on the <strong>Alignment</strong> drop-down located on the left side of the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> 
				above the <strong>Language</strong> pane.</p>

			<p>Once you've selected an alignment you can go back to the <strong>Class</strong> drop-down and select a class for your character. After 
				selecting the class you will make sure that the <strong>Add Levels</strong> text field has a &quot;1&quot; in it and then click on the 
				<strong>+</strong> button. You will next see this warning:</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_07_warning.png" alt="Ability Score Warning"></p>

			<p>It is important to note that many gameModes lock in the intelligence score bonus at 1st level so before you select your first class level 
				you ant to make sure that your ability scores are acceptable. In the case of the sample character, as he is human and we are using the 
				Pathfinder gameMode, he gets to select an ability score bonus. So we'll click the <strong>No</strong> button and then take detour from 
				<strong>Class</strong> selection and take a look at the <strong>Feats &amp; Abilities Tab</strong>. to do this click on the <strong>Ability 
				Bonus Remain to be Selected</strong> in the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane. (Ah ha! a new bit of usability for the PCGen GUI! Thats 
				right! The items in this pane are hot links to the tab where the relevant selections are to be made!)</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Selecting the Human's Ability Score Bonus</strong>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_08_abilities.png" alt="Ability Score Bonus"></p>

			<p>You will note that PCGen has changed to the <strong>Feats &qmp; Abilities Tab</strong> and activated the <strong>Racial Abilities Sub-Tab</strong>. 
				The available ability bonuses are displayed in the left pane while the right pane displays the ability categories <strong>Ability Bonus</strong> 
				and <strong>Human Racial Traits</strong>. If you click on the <strong>Human Racial Traits</strong> in the right pane the abilities listed in the 
				left pane change. These abilities are the &quot;Human Racial Traits&quot; that the character has. For now you can ignore these. Click on the 
				<strong>Ability Bonus</strong> entry in the right pane and the original abilities bonuses reappear in the left pane. Looking at the lower-left 
				pane you will see the same two ability categories. You will also see a set of two numbers, one pair for each ability category. The first number 
				represents the number of abilities of that category available to the character and the second number is the number of ability selections left. 
				For our human you can see tht he has one ability bonus granted and that he has that one still to select. So the next thing we do is select one.</p>

			<p>This is accomplished by clicking on the ability bonus desired and then clicking on the <strong>Add Selected &GT;</strong> button and the selected 
				ability bonus appears in the right pane beneath the <strong>Ability Bonus</strong> category.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_09_selected.png" alt="Selected Ability Score Bonus"></p>

			<p>It's time to return to the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> and the selection of a class for our new character.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>Class Selection, Again</strong>

			<p>Move back to the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> by clicking on its tab just below the <strong>Toolbar</strong>. Once there click on the <strong>Class</strong> 
			drop-down menu and select the desired class. When the warning dialog appears click the <strong>Yes</strong> button. Next a dialog box will pop up, asking 
			you to select a free set of clothing.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_10_clothing.png" alt="Selected a Free Set of Clothing"></p>

			<p>Scroll through the list of clothing and select the desired set. Then click on the <strong>Add</strong> button and then the <strong>Close</strong> button.</p>

<!--
			<p class="sidebar0"><strong>Note:</strong> PCGen has a <a href="../menupages/tools/preferences/preferencescharacteroptions.html#houserules">preference 
				setting</a> that can turn this dialog off</p>
-->

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_11_leveling.png" alt="The Character's First Level"></p>

			<p>The next dialog that pops up shows the class taken, the hit points gained, the hit points rolled, and the skill points granted. Click the <strong>Close</strong> 
				button and the window will close.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>A Few Notes on the <strong>Things to Do</strong> Pane</strong>
			<p>This is as good a time as any to go over a few things concerning the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane.
				<ol type="a">
					<li>As stated before the items listed in this pane are <strong>Hot Links</strong> that will take you to the tab/sub-tab where the relevant selections 
						are to be made. If the selection  to be made is located on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong>, PCgen will highlight the relevant pane on the 
						<strong>Summary Tab</strong>.</li>
					<li>These items are <strong>NOT</strong> listed in the order of priority. They are listed in alphabetical order and can be taken care of in any order 
						desired. Of course there are some options that will be taken that might benefit from other options, but with the shear number of options available 
						variety of effects, there really is no way to definitively determine which item should be handled before any other.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li><strong>The Next Step</strong>

			<p>Reviewing the items listed in the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane I am going to jump to the <strong>Favored Class remain to be selected</strong> item. As 
				before, click on the item. What follows is a sequence of views in which the <strong>Favored Class</strong> and subsequent options are selected. Note the 
				progression of &quot;Total&quot; and &quot;Remaining&quot; selections in the lower-left pane.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_12_favoredclass.png" alt="Favored Class Selection"></p>

			<p>In the <strong>Pathfinder RPG</strong> gamemode a character receives a bonus each time he takes a level in his <strong>Favored Class</strong>. So we will 
				scroll through the list of classes and double-click the new character's <strong>Favored Class</strong>.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_13_favoredbonus.png" alt="Favored Bonus Selection"></p>

			<p>For this option the <strong>Qualified</strong> button has been activated to remove the ineligible options. What is left are three bonuses. Double-click the 
				character's desired bonus.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_14_bonusspell.png" alt="Favored Bonus Spell Selection"></p>

			<p>This is the deepest this particular class' <strong>Favored Class</strong> bonuses go so we will now return to the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> and to the 
				<strong>Skill</strong> selections.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>The Skills the Thing</strong>

			<p>Back on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> we look once again at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane and the next thing on the list is <strong>Skill points 
				remain to be spent</strong>. Click on the <strong>Hot Link</strong> and we'll zip right over to the <strong>Skills Tab</strong>.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_15_skills.png" alt="Skill Selection"></p>

			<p>Your new character will have a number of skill points to spend, a number dependent on the class selected and the character's intelligence bonus. The number 
				of points available can be found in the lower-left pane where, as in the <strong>Feats &amp; Abilities Tab</strong>, you will find the skill points &quot;Gained&quot;
				and &quot;Remaining&quot; listed by level. You can take spend one skill point per skill rank with a limit of one point per level taken. To spend a skill 
				point you will find the skill you wish to spend the point on and then click the up &quot;Arrow&quot;. Note that each class has skills that are considered 
				&quot;Class&quot; skills with the rest being &quot;Non-class&quot; skills. In the <strong>Pathfinder RPG</strong> gameMode the cost of skills are the same 
				whether class or non-class while the <strong>3.5e</strong> gamemode the class skills cost one point and the non-class skills cost two points.</p>

			<p>After spending all available skill points we can go back to the <strong>Summary Tab</strong>.</p>

		</li>

		<li><strong>The Feats the Thing</strong>

			<p>Back on the <strong>Summary Tab</strong> we look once again at the <strong>Things to Do</strong> pane and the next item on the list is <strong>Feat 
				remain to be selected</strong>. Click on the <strong>Hot Link</strong> and we'll zip back to the <strong>Feats &amp; Abilities Tab</strong>.</p>

			<p class="center"><img src="../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_16_feats.png" alt="Feat Selection"></p>

			<p>This is our third trip to the <strong>Feats &amp; Abilities Tab</strong> so you should be familiar with what you'll see here. The lower-left pane shows 
				that the character has a total of 2 feats selections available with only one left to make. Review of the right pane shows there are htree feats appearing 
				in yellow text. These are feats that have been added automatically. these are generally added as class or racial features. <strong>Arane Stike</strong> 
				is included in black text and represens the first of two feat selections. Pick your desired feats and dou ,e click on them to add them to the character.</p>
