	<h1>Proposed Data Inclusion Policy</h1>

	<p>This page contains a proposed change to the PCGen Data Includion Policy.  
	This policy is intended to clarify PCGen's requirements for considering adding 
	a any source datasets to the PCGen repository.</p>
	
	<hr>

	<h2>PCGen Data Inclusion Policy and Procedure</h2>

	<h3>Data Inclusion Policy</h3>

	<p>The following is PCGen&#8217;s policy on including data for distribution. </p>

	<ol class="indent1" style="line-height: 1.5"> 
		<li><strong>Source Ownership:</strong> All source material is owned by the 
		publishers.  As such, PCGen shall comply with all Publisher wishes as it relates 
		to the use and distribution of the their source material in the form of PCGen 
		datasets, whether the material is OGL, Closed Content, or a mixture of the same.</li>
		<li><strong>Publisher Agreements:</strong> All source datasets included within 
		PCGen must be covered under a documented &quot;Publisher Agreement&quot; prior 
		to being uploaded into the PCGen repository. Publisher Agreements shall include 
		the list of sources covered under the agreement, the permissions being granted, 
		general and specific, the type of publisher review required, the date the permissions 
		were granted, and the last date the permissions were confirmed.</li>
		<li><strong>Minimum Permissions Level:</strong> All datasets distributed with PCGen 
		must have as a minimum a granted permission level, from the appropriate publisher, of 
		&quot;OGL+Title&quot;. This will ensure that all data used within PCGen can be properly 
		identified.
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				<li>The only exception to this policy is were a dataset containing only OGL material,
				from a source where the publisher has granted 'OGL Only' permission, and the dataset is used 
				as the foundation for other permissioned source material. In this case, the 'OGL Only' source 
				may be used, at the discretion of PCGen's Board of Directors, as an unidentified dataset 
				to allow includion of the permissioned datasets.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Minimum Dataset Content:</strong> All game-mechanics associated with permissioned 
		game elements, called objects within PCGen, found in a publishers source material (i.e. Abilities 
		&amp; Feats, Classes, Equipment, Domains, Skills, Spells, and Races) are required for a dataset 
		to be considered for inclusion in the PCGen Distribution.
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				<li>Object name. As per the RSRD vs the PHB/DMG/MM, the name can be different 
				than the one used in the book. EXAMPLE: The <em>Quiver of Elhonna</em> from the 
				DMG, &copy;WotC 2003, and not released under the OGL as part of the RSRD, has 
				been replaced within PCGen by the <em>Efficient Quiver</em>, &copy;PCGen 2001-2007, 
				and released under the OGL as part of PCGen's RSRD Dataset conversion.</li>
				<li>Access to any rule associated with a permissioned object. If a permissioned 
				object description/mechanic includes data that is used for calculations of any 
				sort, PCGen must have access to that data to allow the calculation and display 
				of all the derived values for the game features. Examples of such data include 
				weapon damage stats, [Please provide additional examples].</li>
				<li>Access to any rule associated with a non-permissioned object that is required 
				to allow the proper use of an effected permissioned object. If a non-permissioned 
				object description/mechanic includes data that is used for calculations of any 
				sort within a permissioned object, PCGen must have access to the non-permissioned 
				data to allow the calculation and display of all derived values for the game features.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Data Not Included in Datasets:</strong> PCGen will not incorporate the following in any 
		distributed dataset, making owning the source necessary to use the dataset.
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				<li>The description of any game mechanic, using the permissioned data soley for the calculations 
				described above.</li>
				<li>'Fluff' content, i.e. detailed object description or story-line.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Data Inclusion Procedure</h3>

	<p>The following is the procedure to be followed for including a dataset in PCGen for distribution. </p>

	<ol class="indent1" style="line-height: 1.5"> 
		<li>PCGen&#8217;s publisher liaison team contacts the publisher and asks for 
		permission to include one or more of their sources in PCGen&#8217;s distribution.</li>
		<li>If the publisher agrees, they will be asked if they wish to review the dataset prior
		to it&#8217;s released.</li>
		<li>Data monkeys works on the dataset.</li>
		<li>When completed, the dataset will be reviewed by the OGL team to make sure that it 
		complies with the OGL and with the publisher&#8217;s declaration of PI and OGC.</li>
		<li>The dataset is reviewed by a data chimp as part of PCGen&#8217;s internal quality 
		assurance review.</li>
  		<li>If a publisher review is not required go to step 10 below.</li>
		<li>The dataset is then provided to the publisher </li>
		<li>If the publisher deems it complete and ready for inclusion, then it will be 
		added to PCGen&#8217;s distribution. </li>
		<li>If the publisher has issues with the dataset, those issues are corrected, and 
		the process repeats with step 5 above.</li>
 		<li>The Content SB, Data 2nd, or Data Chimp reviews the set and decides whether 
 		the dataset should be released as &quot;Production&quot; or &quot;Alpha&quot;.</li>
 		<li>The dataset is entered into the repository for distribution.</li>
