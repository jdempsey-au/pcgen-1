<h3>Article I (Name)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The name of this organization is to be PCGen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Article II (Purpose)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of PCGen is to create a character generator for all role-playing 
    games.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Article III (Membership)</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Section 1</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Membership to PCGen is open to anyone. Members of PCGen are all volunteers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 2: PCGen sub-teams</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>PCGen is composed of numerous sub-teams that make up the whole. These teams 
      are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Code</li>
      <li>Data</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>

      <li>Trackers</li>
      <li>Licenses</li>
      <li>Publisher Liaison</li>
      <li>GMGen</li>
      <li>Moderator</li>
	  <li>Releases and Installers</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 3: Ranking</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Each team is composed of one or more people. Each team will have at least 
      one Silverback. The<br>
      duties of the Silverback(s) are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Help recruit and train new members</li>
      <li>If requested, help mediate any team-member related tensions</li>
      <li>Remove inactive members from their group</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Below the Silverbacks, in decreasing status, are the following ranks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chimp</li>
      <li>Gibbon</li>
      <li>Tamarin</li>
      <li>Lemur</li>
      <li>Ooze</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <strong>Section 4: Code</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Code sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. If requested, help a new team member spec out how they will implement 
        the assigned task. This may entail helping them come up with proposed 
        data syntax additions or modifications.</p>
      <p>2. Can grant approval to a coder to check in during a code-freeze, though 
        this approval, and subsequent confirmation that the check in is complete, 
        must be sent to the person performing the release so the release isn&#8217;t 
        done before the check in is complete.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 5: Data</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Data sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. If requested, help new team members design data syntax for trackers</p>
      <p>2. Generally speaking, a silverback should be in charge of any books 
        being actively developed for a publisher (each book could be taken by 
        a different silverback). This silverback would be responsible for making 
        sure that it works properly before letting the Data BoD member know to 
        report to the BoD that the book is ready to be sent to the publisher.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 6: Documentation</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Documentation sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. Making sure that the documentation is comprehensive (covering GUI, 
        FAQ and lst syntax)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 7: Output Sheets</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Output Sheet sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. Help design Output Sheet Token syntax for new tokens (with the goal 
        of keeping things as simple and consistent as possible).</p>
      <p>2. Respond to Bug and Freq trackers in as timely a manner as possible</p>
      <p>3. Create new output sheets and improve older ones as better methods 
        develop</p>
      <p>4. Coordinate/communicate with Data and Code teams as necessary for the 
        best resolution to any Bug/Freq that might involve more than just the 
        output sheet team.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 8: Trackers</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Tracker sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. Prioritize trackers according to the agreed upon policy from the BoD</p>
      <p>2. Help administer trackers to make sure important ones are being actively 
        worked on</p>
      <p>3. Delete duplicate trackers</p>
      <p>4. Confirm bugs</p>
      <p>5. Gather freqs and bugs as reported from the various forums</p>
      <p>6. Seek clarification on any trackers that require more information</p>
      <p>7. Periodically sweep through code, data and doc groups to see if any 
        one has been inactive for more than 3 months - contact them and ask if 
        they intend to become active soon (if they won't become active, send the 
        appropriate silverback a note indicating<br>
        they can be removed)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 9: Licenses</strong></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. Review existing data from time to time to make sure it's compliant 
        with applicable licenses</p>
      <p>2. Review any data submissions to publishers to make sure they comply 
        with licenses</p>
      <p>3. Handle any license related questions requested by the Board or silverbacks</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 10: Publisher Liaison</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Duties of the Publisher Liaison sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1. Contact and maintain relationship with as many publishers as possible</p>
      <p>2. Seek permission to include data in PCGen (though we don't want to 
        get permission for too much more than we can handle in the next month 
        or so, otherwise we get permission for a book but can't actually get to 
        it for a year!)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. If requested, help a new team member spec out how they will implement 
        the assigned task.</p>
      <p>2. Can grant approval to a coder to check in during a code-freeze, though 
        this approval, and subsequent confirmation that the check in is complete, 
        must be sent to the person performing the release so the release isn&#8217;t 
        done before the check in is complete.</p>
      <p>3. Assist team members in their understanding of the plugin architecture, 
        and in the design and specification of new plugins.</p>
      <p>4. Interface with code and data teams to solve GMGen specific problems.

    <p>Duties of the Special Projects sub-team include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>1. If a project requires a coder, work with that coder to fully specify 
        the design.</p>
      <p> 2. If the project requires a data monkey, work with the data monkey 
        to full specify the syntax.</p>
      <p>3. Help coordinate the efforts of the code and data workers if both are 
        required on the task.</p>

<h3>Article IV: Board of Directors</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>PCGen shall be run by a Board of Directors. This board shall be constituted 
    by at least one Silverback from each of the sub-teams and be chaired by the 
    Benevolent Dictator. One person can represent more than one team if needed. 
    The size of the Board may vary with time. Duties of the board shall include, 
    but not be limited to:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. A tracker needs clarification/prioritization or syntax can't be agreed 
      upon</p>
    <p>2. Finding a resource to address an important issue is proving to be difficult</p>
    <p> 3. There's some tension on or between team members that requires attention</p>
    <p>4. Someone has done work above and beyond the call of duty, and the BoD 
      needs to be aware of it and acknowledge it</p>
    <p>5. Ability to observe any other sub-team in PCGen. If a board member wishes 
      to actively participate in that sub-team, they will need to follow the lead 
      of that team&#8217;s Silverback(s). A list of the current members of the 
      Board shall be available for anyone to see. This list will include what 
      sub-team(s) they are from and a preferred method of contacting them.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Article V: Meetings</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Section 1</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Board of Directors shall meet at least once a month. The Benevolent 
      Dictator shall announce these meetings, and how they are to be carried out, 
      to the Board at least one week in advance. If any items before the Board 
      are to be voted on, a quorum (50% + 1) of the Board shall be present at 
      the meeting. If a quorum does not prevail, then no voting can take place. 
      A log of the Board meetings shall be kept for posterity. Minutes of the 
      Board meeting shall be provided to the PCGen volunteers so that they may 
      see what is going with the group.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Section 2</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The sub-teams shall meet in a manner most conducive for their work, as 
      guided by the subteam&#8217;s Silverback(s).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Article VI: Voting</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most items brought before the Board to be voted on will only require a simple 
    (50% + 1) majority to pass. Amending these Bylaws, increasing/decreasing the 
    size of the board and disciplining a volunteer in PCGen shall require a major 
    (2/3) majority.</p>
