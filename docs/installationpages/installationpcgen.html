		<h1>Installing PCGen Manually</h1>
		
		<p>If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can either install 
		the new version into a new directory or overwrite the old version currently on your 
		system.</p>
		
		<p><strong>CAUTION! UPGRADING IS NOT FOOLPROOF AND IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK 100%.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Installing a new version over an old version of PCGen may cause issues when you attempt to run the new version.
		See Upgrading PCGen for further info.</p>
		
		<p>A fresh install is best performed by unzipping pcgenXXX_full.zip to a desired folder on your computer.
		To run the application, run either pcgen.bat (which will also open a debug window which will display any errors during the run)
		or pcgen.jar (The Java executeable)</p>
		
		<p>To transfer characters from one version of PCGen to the new version of PCGen, all you
		need to do is copy the pcg files from the &quot;characters&quot; directory from the old 
		version of PCGen to the new version.</p>
		
		<p>NOTE: If you copy PCGen from one location to another you must delete the options.ini 
		file. This file holds directory locations which will no longer be valid! Deleting the options.ini file will reset PCGen to all its default
		settings so ensure that you have made a note of you current settings before
		proceeding. A new file will be created when PCGen is started if necessary.</p>
