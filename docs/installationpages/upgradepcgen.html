		<h1>Upgrading PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can overwrite it with a newer version to maintain your settings and the location of your characters.</p>
		
		<p><strong>CAUTION! UPGRADING IS NOT FOOLPROOF AND IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK 100%.</strong></p>
		
		<p>Installing a new version over an old version of PCGen may cause issues when you attempt to run the new version.
		If you experience some unexpected behaviour of the application after upgrading, please try deleting options.ini (or renaming it if you want to preserve the file).
		Options.ini contains information who´s structure or contents may have changed with a new PCGen version, rendering it useless if different implementations become mixed in the file for one reason or other.</p>
		
		<h2>To upgrade:</h2>
		
		<p>1. Locate your PCGen directory. e.g. C:\PCGen</p>
		
		<p>2. Make a backup of all files in case something goes wrong!</p>
		
		<p>3. Unzip the pcgenXXX_patch.zip over your previous PCGen installation.</p>
