		<h1>Upgrading PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can overwrite it with a newer version to maintain your settings and the location of your characters.</p>
		
		<p><strong>CAUTION! UPGRADING IS NOT FOOLPROOF!</strong></p>
		
		<p>Installing a new version over an old version of PCGen may cause the new version to not run well. 
		If you experience some unexpected behavior of the application after upgrading, please try deleting options.ini 
		(or renaming it if you want to preserve the file). 
		Options.ini contains information on structure and contents that may have changed with the new version 
		rendering it useless if different implementations become mixed in the file.</p>
		
		<h2>To upgrade:</h2>
		
		<p>1. Locate your PCGen directory. e.g. C:\PCGen</p>
		
		<p>2. Make a backup of all files in case something goes wrong!</p>
		
		<p>3. Unzip the pcgenXXX_patch.zip over your previous PCGen installation.</p>
