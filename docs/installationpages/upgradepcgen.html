		<h1>Upgrading PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>If you have PCGen Currently installed on your system, you can overwrite it with a newer version 
			to maintain your settings and the location of your characters. This will unfortunately, unless 
			you have taken precautions against it, also overwrite your homebrew and custom datasets as well 
			as your homebrew gamemode folder. This page provides some guidance in how best to avoid these 
			problems by helping you prepare your homebrew and custom data for transfer into an updated 
			version of PCGen.</p>

		<p class="sidebar1">WARNING: The data syntax for the old version of PCGen may be incorrect 
			for the new version so before you start up PCGen you should verify your data's compatibility 
			with the new version of PCGen. You can check with the PCGen community forums to find out what 
			tools may be available to help you with this task.</p>

		<h3>Preparing for the Upgrade</h3>
		
		<p class="indent0">Copy the following files to a protected location just in case you need to 
			restore them after the upgrade.</p>
		<dl class="indent1">
			<dt><span class="lstfile">filepaths.ini</span></dt>
			<dd>This file tells PCGen the location of the other ini files so you can change the 
				<span class="lstfile">filepaths.ini</span> to point to the folder which 
				contains the <span class="lstfile">options.ini</span> and 
				<span class="lstfile">filter.ini</span> that you want to use.</dd>
			<dt><span class="lstfile">options.ini</span></dt>
			<dd>This file holds your PCGen Preferences such as file paths so if you are going to 
				point to your old one you may need to correct various paths to things such as the 
				location of the output sheets.</dd>
			<p class="sidebar1">WARNING: Installing a new version of PCGen over an old version may cause the 
				new version to not run well. If you experience some unexpected behavior after upgrading, please 
				try deleting the <span class="lstfile">options.ini</span> file, or you may choose to rename it 
				in order to preserve the file. The <span class="lstfile">options.ini</span> file contains 
				information on structure and contents that may have changed with the new version, rendering 
				it useless if different implementations become mixed in the file.</p>
		
			<dt><span class="lstfile">filter.ini</span></dt>
			<dd>This file holds the various filters on each of the tabs. (See the filter button in the docs)</dd>
			<dt>Custom Datasets</dt>
				<dd>Custom datasets are datasets that are created and maintained by PCGen through 
					the use of the PCGen's built-in LST File Editors. If you have used the built-in LST 
					file editors, these files should be backed up as part of your upgrade preparations. 
					Once upgrading has been completed, these files can be copied over the new files in 
					the $PCEGN_HOME/data/customsources folder.</dd>
			<dt>Homebrew Datasets</dt>
			<dd>Homebrew datasets are files that are created and maintained by the user and are generally 
				stored in the $PCGEN_HOME/data/<your campaign> folder. If you have have any homebrew LST 
				files, these files should be backed up as part of your upgrade preparations. Once upgrading 
				has been completed, these files can be copied into the new $PCGEN_HOME/data/<your campaign> 
				folder.</dd>
			<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: Homebrew LST files copied from older versions of PCGen may contain 
				obsolete or deprecated tags or tag syntax. This means you may have to review and update 
				any LST objects contained in such files to the latest standard.</p>
			<dt>Homebrew Gamemode Files</dt>
			<dd>If you're using your own gamemode files, you'll need to back-up the <my campaign> gamemode 
				folder as part of the upgrade preparations. Once upgrading is complete this folder can be 
				copied into $PCGEN_HOME/system/gamemode folder.</dd>
			<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: Homebrew LST files copied from older versions of PCGen may contain 
				obsolete or deprecated tags or tag syntax. This means you may have to review and update 
				any LST objects contained in such files to the latest standard.</p>
		</dl>

		<h3>Installing the Upgrade:</h3>
		
		<p class="indent1">1. Locate your PCGen directory. e.g. C:\PCGen</p>
		
		<p class="indent1">2. Unzip the pcgenXXX_full.zip over your previous PCGen installation.</p>

		<p class="indent1">3. Copy the old <span class="lstfile">*.ini</span> files, custom datasets, 
			homebrew datasets, and homebrew gamemode files, as required, back to your PCGen directory.</p>
