		<h1>Installation of Java and PCGen</h1>
		
		<p>The following sections describe how to install Java and PCGen Manually for PC, Macintosh, 
		and the *nix varieties.</p>
		
		<p>The first section describes the steps for manually installing Java on your specific OS and how 
		to determine what version you may have and which version to install.</p>
		
		<p>The later sections describes how to install PCGen directly from the zip files, and how to upgrade from a previous version.</p>
		<p>As of version 5.5 PCGen is distributed in 3 different versions:</p>
		<ol class="indent2">
			<li>pcgenXXX_full.zip : everything including GMGen and PDF, best installed in new directory.</li>
			<li>pcgenXXX_patch.zip : everything that's changed since the latest point realease (e.g. 5.6.0), install over any version within the same major version (5.6.1 to 5.6.x).</li>
			<li>pcgenXXX_partial.zip : everything except GMGen and PDF, best installed in new directory.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Where XXX is the version number of PCGen (e.g. 560 for version 5.6.0.)</p>

	<p>For users who have trouble getting the zip files to unzip properly, we have some OS-specific installs that should help minimize the chance of install related errors. Links to these installs can be found at the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Alternate%20PCGen%20Releases/">alternate release site.</a></p>
	<p>These are the same PCGen version everyone else is using, just packaged with installers which target Windows and Mac OS X users specifically. Typically there is a gap between when the official release is done and when these special installers are ready.</p>
