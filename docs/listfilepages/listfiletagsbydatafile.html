		<p>The Meat &amp; Potatoes of it all! The Holy Grail has been found! Houston, we have landed on 
		the Moon!</p>
		
		<p>Well, okay, so maybe not that exciting, but it is as good as sliced bread.&nbsp; A file by file 
		listing of all the tags currently in use by PCGen's list files! How, what, 
		why, where, when... all these questions answered!</p>
		
		<p>Converting from Code-ese to English is a tough task, so hopefully these pages are a coherent enough form 
		of English for everyone! (and if you speak Code-ese, go away! You're a 
		Code Monkey, this area is for List Monkeys! :p)</p>
