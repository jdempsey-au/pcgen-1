		<p class="indent0">Beginning with PCGen 5.12, and maturing in PCGen 5.14, the Ability 
			object has been available to the lst monkey as a more flexible tool than the existing 
			Feat object. Though it was originally conceived as a replacement for the Feat, it will 
			still take quite some time before the Feat actually goes away, if it ever does.</p>
		<p class="indent0">This lesson will assist users in converting their existing homebrew feats 
			to the new Ability object. Each section represents a different LST file and will explain
			the conversion, through discussion and examples of the tags used within each file, of your 
			homebrew feats.</p>
		<p class="indent0">For those of you that have gone through the previous LST Classes, some of 
			the global tags will be repetitive. feel free to skip those portions if you like. These 
			classes are being written for the new LST-Monkey, so there will be some overlap, but a 
			student of the classes does not need to take them in order.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate what you would see in a LST 
  		file we are going to use certain conventions to convey these ideas:</p>
		<p class="indent1">1) Angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) are used to indicate where your text will be 
			entered when building your LST files. Unless explicitly stated in the text of my explanation, 
			you will not include the angle brackets in your tags.</p>
		<p class="indent1">2) Coding examples and PCGen tags are identified by <code>code</code> 
			style.</p>
		<p class="indent1">3) When referencing a specific PCGen object, i.e. domain, feat, weapon, etc., 
			I have included the name as a <span class="lstobj">LST Object</span> text, except for when 
			the object is part of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> example.</p>
		<p class="indent1">4) Each new line should be considered a <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> in the actual file.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p class="indent1">So examples in this lesson will appear as:</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code></p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
			<p class="indent1">While in the LST file will appear as:</p>
			<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>The PCC File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">PCGen uses the <code>ABILITY:ability.lst</code> tag to identify the files in 
			which PCGen's new &quot;Ability&quot; objects can be found and loaded into PCGen. Likewise, 
			PCGen uses the <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:abilitycategory.lst</code> tag to identify the files in 
			which PCGen will find the &quot;Ability Categories&quot; required to implement the new abilities. 
			More information can be found in the <a href="lfc_lesson01_pcc.html">PCC LST File Class</a></p>

		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>ABILITY</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent0">PCGen uses the <code>ABILITY:ability.lst</code> tag to identify the files in 
			which PCGen's new &quot;Ability&quot; objects can be found and loaded into PCGen.</p>

		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent0">PCGen uses the <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:abilitycategory.lst</code> tag to identify 
			the files in which PCGen will find the &quot;Ability Categories&quot; required to implement 
			the new abilities.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>ABILITY:my_ability.lst</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:my_abilitycategory.lst</code></p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>Miscinfo.lst or Abilitycategory.lst  File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">For Homebrews you'll need to set up any special &quot;abilities&quot; 
			in their own pools. To demonstrate this, we'll use the sample ability category shown below:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>PLURAL:Class Ability Categories</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITABLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>POOL:0</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>

<hr>

		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>ABILITYCATEGORY</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines the Ability Category. This is what will show in the PCGen user interface, under the FEATs tab.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>CATEGORY</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This is a 'sub-category'. You'll note we leave it the same for this example 
			but you can have the same ability name as long as it has a different category name. As an 
			example, you could have an ability <span class="lstobj">FooBarSneak</span> of 
			<code>CATEGORY:Ambush</code>, and an ability <span class="lstobj">FooBarSneak</span> 
			of <code>CATEGORY:Rogue</code> with no conflicts within PCGen.</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: Categories may be different, you can make any category you want as long as 
			it is defined in either the <span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> or 
			<span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> file.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>PLURAL</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This has to do with the internationalization. An example is: in_feats which sets the 
			Category key to 'in_feats'. It also shows up with the 'Plural' of the name. Ex. Feat would be Feats 
			(Feats would display in the drop down bar).</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>EDITABLE</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether a user can modify the abilities in the category. NO would be 
			appropriate for class abilities which aren't chosen by the user.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>EDITPOOL</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether a user can modify the pool number or not. Each ability has a 
			'cost' (Default is 1) if this option is set to 'NO' the user cannot add or subtract from the pool. 
			For feats, the default is 'YES'.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>FRACTIONALPOOL</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether the pool must be a whole number or can be fractions. Some 
			abilities may have a cost less than '1' like .5 or .25. &lt;YES / NO&gt;</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>POOL</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">0 unless you want a formula to determine the pool number. Example: TL/2 would 
			grant one point every 2 levels to the character. </p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>VISIBLE</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">Defines whether this category is visible on the UI or hidden. Usefull for hidden 
			abilities and class abilities that require no interaction from the user. &lt;Options are - YES, 
			NO, QUALIFY&gt;</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>Ability.lst File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">This is where your feat will be placed. You will need to add 'CATEGORY' to your feat to make it an ability.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>My Feat</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:General</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>DESC:&lt;appropriate description&gt;</code></p>
		<p class="indent)">You may continue to use 
			<a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#PREFEAT">PREFEAT</a>, 
			but it is recommended that you use 
			<a href="../globalfilestagpages/globalfilesprexxx.html#PREABILITY">PREABILITY</a> instead.</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<p class="indent0">Ability Name</p>
		<p class="indent1">The first line is the Name of the Ability, you can have any name you prefer 
			that makes sense. In ths example we are using a shortened name to simplify the lesson.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>CATEGORY</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This places the ability named in the 'FEAT' category.  Note the ALL CAPS if 
			making an actual FEAT; other abilitiy categories can be whatever name you decide upon&gt;</p>
		<p class="sidebar1">NOTE: Any category, besides 'FEAT', must have been defined in the 
			<span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> or <span class="lstfile">abilitycategory.lst</span> 
			file to be valid.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>TYPE</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">We have a period '.' delimiter to give the ability more than one 'type'. In 
			this case we have 'General' as a 'type'. Same as standard feats '.' period delimiter.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>VISIBLE</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">Setting the visible to YES (which is default) allows the user to see this 
			on the GUI in PCGen. DISPLAY, NO, YES and QUALIFY are the valid entries.</p>
		<p class="indent0"><strong><code>DESC</code></strong></p>
		<p class="indent1">This is where you type the text you want to appear with your chosen ability. 
			This will be displayed on the character sheet UNLESS the ability is set to NO or DISPLAY. 
			In that case you would skip this tag and may instead use 'SA:' tag 5.12 and earlier or 'SAB:' 
			tag (5.14) in it's place. You may also use %1, %2 for variables defined. See DESC tag for 
			further details.</p>
		<p></p>
		
<hr>

		<p class="indent0">Unless you've made a new ABILITYCATEGORY, all feats converted to Abilities 
			will show up on the 'Feats' tab as normal. Great examples of new ABILITY CATEGORIES can 
			be seen in the rsrd/srd for the Fighter, Wizard and Rogue class.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Remember, miscinfo.lst is a gamemode file, to define new ability categories 
			or subcategories you MUST create it there. There are entries about them in the docs if you 
			want to read up on them.  To call the ability file it's (as you guessed), ABILITY:ability.lst, 
			in the .pcc file. Basically pretend that an ability.lst is a feat file as far as what tags 
			you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair warning though, there may be exceptions to that 
			rule of thumb).</p>
