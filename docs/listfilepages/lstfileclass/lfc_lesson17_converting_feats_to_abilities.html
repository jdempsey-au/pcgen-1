		<p class="indent0">This is a lesson to assist users in converting existing feats to the new 
			ability object. Each section represents a different file and the tags used in that that 
			you'll need. Provided with the included tags is a sample in each section. So if you copy 
			these examples verbatim you'll have a good start. Above is referenced the actual tags for 
			the full capabilities. Each new line should be considered a <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> in 
			the actual file.</p>
		<p class="indent1">So,</p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent1">In the lst file becomes:</p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code> &lt;tab&gt; <code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>

<hr>

		<h3>The PCC File</h3>
		<p class="indent1">Abilities have a different file type from feats. Use <code>ABILITY:</code> to 
			tell PCGen where to find the newly converted abilities, and we use <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:</code>
			to tell PCGen where to find the new ability categories that our new abilities belong to.</p>
		<p class="indent1">Example:</p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITY:my_ability.lst</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:my_abilitycategory.lst</code></p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>Miscinfo.lst or Abilitycategory.lst  File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">For Homebrews you'll need to set up any special &quot;abilities&quot; 
			in their own pools. To demonstrate this, we'll use the sample ability category shown below:</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>ABILITYCATEGORY:My Ability Category</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>PLURAL:Class Ability Categories</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITABLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>POOL:0</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent1">--</p>
		<p class="indent0">ABILITYCATEGORY</p>
		<p class="indent1">This makes the Ability Category. This is what will show in the PCGen user interface, under the FEATs tab.</span></p>
		<p class="indent0">CATEGORY</p>
		<p class="indent1">This is a 'sub' category. You'll note we leave it the same for this example but you can have the same ability name as long as it has a different category name. For example: CATEGORY:Ambush could contain 'FooBarSneak' and then you could have CATEGORY:Rogue with 'FooBarSneak'</span></p>
		<p class="indent2">NOTE:Categories may be different, you can make any category you want as long as 
			it is defined in either the <span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> or 
			<span class="lstfile">miscinfo.lst</span> file.</p>
		<p class="indent0">PLURAL</p>
		<p class="indent1">This has to do with the internationalization. An example is: in_feats which sets the 
			Category key to 'in_feats'. It also shows up with the 'Plural' of the name. Ex. Feat would be Feats 
			(Feats would display in the drop down bar).</p>
		<p class="indent0">EDITABLE</p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether a user can modify the abilities in the category. NO would be 
			appropriate for class abilities which aren't chosen by the user.</p>
		<p class="indent0">EDITPOOL</p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether a user can modify the pool number or not. Each ability has a 
			'cost' (Default is 1) if this option is set to 'NO' the user cannot add or subtract from the pool. 
			For feats, the default is 'YES'.</p>
		<p class="indent0">FRACTIONALPOOL</p>
		<p class="indent1">This defines whether the pool must be a whole number or can be fractions. Some 
			abilities may have a cost less than '1' like .5 or .25. &lt;YES / NO&gt;</p>
		<p class="indent0">POOL</p>
		<p class="indent1">0 unless you want a formula to determine the pool number. Example: TL/2 would 
			grant one point every 2 levels to the character. </p>
		<p class="indent0">VISIBLE</p>
		<p class="indent1">Defines whether this category is visible on the UI or hidden. Usefull for hidden 
			abilities and class abilities that require no interaction from the user. &lt;Options are - YES, 
			NO, QUALIFY&gt;</p>
		<p></p>

<hr>

		<h3>Ability.lst File</h3>
		<p class="indent0">This is where your feat will be placed. You will need to add 'CATEGORY' to your feat to make it an ability.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>My Feat</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>CATEGORY:FEAT</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>TYPE:General</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent2"><code>DESC:&lt;appropriate description&gt;</code></p>
		<p class="indent)">You may continue to use PREFEAT, but it is recommended that you use PREABILITY. See tag for details.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p class="indent0">--</p>
		<p class="indent0">Ability Name</p>
		<p class="indent1">The first line is the Name of the Ability, you can have any name you prefer 
			that makes sense. In ths example we are using a shortened name to simplify the lesson.</p>
		<p class="indent0">CATEGORY</code></p>
		<p class="indent1">This places the ability named in the 'FEAT' category.  Note the ALL CAPS if 
			making an actual FEAT; other abilitiy categories can be whatever name you decide upon&gt;</p>
		<p class="indent0">NOTE: Any category, besides 'FEAT', must have been defined in the miscinfo.lst 
			file to be valid.</p>
		<p class="indent0">TYPE</p>
		<p class="indent1">We have a period '.' delimiter to give the ability more than one 'type'. In 
			this case we have 'General' as a 'type'. Same as standard feats '.' period delimiter.</p>
		<p class="indent0">VISIBLE</p>
		<p class="indent1">Setting the visible to YES (which is default) allows the user to see this 
			on the GUI in PCGen. DISPLAY, NO, YES and QUALIFY are the valid entries.</p>
		<p class="indent0">DESC</p>
		<p class="indent1">This is where you type the text you want to appear with your chosen ability. 
			This will be displayed on the character sheet UNLESS the ability is set to NO or DISPLAY. 
			In that case you would skip this tag and may instead use 'SA:' tag 5.12 and earlier or 'SAB:' 
			tag (5.14) in it's place. You may also use %1, %2 for variables defined. See DESC tag for 
			further details.</p>
		<p></p>
		
<hr>

		<p class="indent0">Unless you've made a new ABILITYCATEGORY, all feats converted to Abilities 
			will show up on the 'Feats' tab as normal. Great examples of new ABILITY CATEGORIES can 
			be seen in the rsrd/srd for the Fighter, Wizard and Rogue class.</p>
		<p class="indent0">Remember, miscinfo.lst is a gamemode file, to define new ability categories 
			or subcategories you MUST create it there. There are entries about them in the docs if you 
			want to read up on them.  To call the ability file it's (as you guessed), ABILITY:ability.lst, 
			in the .pcc file. Basically pretend that an ability.lst is a feat file as far as what tags 
			you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair warning though, there may be exceptions to that 
			rule of thumb).</p>
