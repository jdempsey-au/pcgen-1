		<h1>New Source Development</h1>
		
		<p>This is the process for developing datasets for inclusion in PCGen. Those familiar 
  		with how this process has worked in the past will note that it is essentially 
  		unchanged with the exception that the the point at which a review of the source 
  		for OGL compliance and Publisher permission needed before the source can be 
  		entered into the CVS repository is now handled on an internal tracker by the 
  		Publisher Liaison, OGL and Content Silverbacks.</p>
		
		<h2>Initial Development</h2>
		
		<p>It begins as always with our volunteers creating the datasets. The style 
      	of this stage of development is entirely up the individual monkey who is 
      	developing the set, they are free to upload the work to pcgen_experimental 
      	for review or not. Smaller sources being done by individually monkeys should 
      	ideally be complete or near complete before being submitted for entry into 
      	CVS. Larger projects, such as core sources or SRD additions that are being 
      	developed by several monkeys which could benefit from the cooperative nature 
      	of CVS do not have to be complete but should be a good ways towards this 
      	point. It will be the Lead Data Monkeys call when it should be submitted.</p>
		
		<h2>Resources</h2>
		
		<p>The following resources are available to aid volunteers learn 
  		to create LST files. The first place to go is the Documentation, which you are 
  		reading now. There are a variety of pages dealing with LST files designed to 
  		help get you up and running. For beginners we have a growing section of lessons 
  		in the <a href="lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">LST file Class</a>. 
  		If you are creating datasets for inclusion in PCGen you should pay close attention 
  		to the section on <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html"> Official Release LST 
  		standards</a> especially to the section on <a href="listfileLSTstandards.html#ogl">OGL Compliance</a>. 
		The docs are also available <a href="http://www.legolas.org/pcgen/docs/">online</a> 
  		on our <a href="http://www.legolas.org/pcgen/">autobuild site</a> and are updated periodically.</p>

		<p>In addition to the main <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/">PCGen 
  		Yahoo group</a> we have several other lists to aid in data development. 
		<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">pcgen_experimental</a> 
  		is used for development. You can get in touch with other data monkeys here and 
  		upload your files for others to review. It is a good place to coordinate activity 
  		if multiple monkeys are working on a source. Additionally it is the place where 
  		new LST syntax and new tags are developed. 
		<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/">PCGenListFileHelp</a> 
  		is the place to go for help with specific how-to problems with LST files. 
		<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/">LSTFileClass</a> 
  		is a group set up to publish lessons on how to create LST files. The LST File 
  		Classes here in the docs were originally published there. We also have a 
		<a href="http://gmgen.sourceforge.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> 
  		site which has a page set aside to inform the community of 
		<a href="http://gmgen.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main/SourcesInDevelopment">progress 
  		made with New Sources</a>. The <a href="http://gmgen.sourceforge.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> 
  		site can be edited by anyone and we encourage those engaged in data development 
  		to post your progress there.</p>
	  
	  	<h2>Inclusion in CVS</h2>
		
		<p>When a source has been completed and is ready for inclusion 
  		in the program it may be submitted in one of several ways. Data sets can be 
  		uploaded to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/">pcgen_experimental</a> 
  		to the appropriate folder and, along with a shout out to your friendly neighborhood 
  		tracker monkey, they will be picked up for review. Datasets can also be entered 
  		into the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=450173&group_id=36698&func=browse">List 
  		File Fixes/New List Files</a> tracker at PCGEN:DM, which is the Data Management 
  		project for PCGen. Once submitted the data must pass an internal review before 
  		it can be included in the CVS repository.</p>

		<p>When a new source is submitted for inclusion in PCGen an internal 
  		tracker is opened for the Source. This is a special tracker for tracking New 
  		Source Development and will be the repository for all permission and OGL status 
  		reports concerning the source. This tracker will only contain permission and 
  		OGL status reports, bug reports and the like will be entered in separately in 
  		the regular bug trackers. It will be closed when it has passed all the required 
  		reviews and is checked in to the CVS repository.</p>

		<p>New submission trackers will be opened by the Content Silverback or the 
      	Chief Data Monkey. The dataset will be checked for obvious errors that would 
      	prevent it from running in PCGen as well as for completeness. Basically 
      	we are checking for show stoppers and not much more. If we find a major 
      	problem we will contact the author to get it resolved.</p>
		
		<p>If the dataset meets these minimum requirement it is zipped 
  		up and attached to the tracker. The tracker is then reassigned to the Open Game 
  		License (OGL) personnel. If problems are found the tracker is reassigned back 
  		to Data who will work to resolve the issue. Once resolved tracker is again reassigned 
  		to OGL.</p>
		
		<p>When OGL passes the Source it is reassigned to Publisher Liaison (PL) who 
      	will attach publisher permission to the tracker, though the PL need not 
      	wait for this step and may attach permissions at any time he receives them.</p>
		
		<p>When the source has passed OGL and PL the tracker is reassigned to the 
      	Lead Data Monkey who will CVS the dataset in the appropriate directory. The tracker is then closed.</p>
		
		<h2>Alpha Development</h2>
		
		<p>At this point the dataset author will be invited to continue 
  		development and be granted CVS access to continue work on the set. QA should 
  		be informed that a new set is in CVS which needs to be reviewed. The author, 
  		the QA team and the Tracker Monkey team will then work together to bring the 
 	 	set up to release quality. Alpha sets will be listed on the 
		<a href="http://gmgen.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main/AlphaSourcesInQA">Alpha QA</a> 
		page of the Wiki site. Once the Dataset has been though the QA process 
  		and all known issues have been resolved it is moved into a permanent location 
  		in the data directory. </p>
