	<h2>Implementation Discussion</h2>

	<p class="indent1">This is a lesson to assist users in setting up things such as  buying abilities via 
	Skill Ranks or known as Skill Tricks. Each section represents a different file and what tags you'll 
	need. Provided with the included tags is a sample in each section. So if you copy these examples 
	verbatim you'll have a good start. Above is referenced the actual tags for the full capabilities. 
	The TOP header <strong>bolded</strong> text is the file where these tags need to be placed. Each 
	new line should be considered a TAB in the actual file.</p>

	<p class="indent1">Using this, you merely dump skill points into the ST Skill and then flip to the feats tab and the STs sub-tab and choose the ones you want. Hope that helps. </p>

	<p class="indent1">Remember, miscinfo.lst and statsandchecks.lst are gamemode files. They do not get referenced in the .pcc file directly. There are entries about them in the docs if you want to read up on them. Anyway, to make a long story somewhat shorter, what you want to do is go to the “pcgen/system/gamemodes/35e” directory, open the miscinfo.lst file there and add the information I gave you in the post (right below the Salient Divine Abilities entry would work :p). Then open up the statasandchecks.lst file and add the VAR definition as I described before. To call the ability file it's (as you guessed) “ABILITY:ability.lst” in the .pcc file. Basically pretend that an ability.lst is a feat file as far as what tags you can use in it and you'll be ok (fair warning though, there may be exceptions to that rule of thumb). </p>

	<p class="indent1">We will discuss, below, each of the LST entries required, and the tags that make 
	them work, to implement these priesthoods. For assistance in understanding how to read this page you 
	may review the <a href="../rulesguide/game_rules_reading_instructions.html">Rules Style Guide</a>.</p>

	<h3>Miscinfo.lst File</h3>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>ABILITYCATEGORY:ST</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This makes the Ability Category. 
		This is what will show in the PCGen user interface, under the FEATs tab.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>CATEGORY:ST</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This is a 'sub' category. You'll 
		note we leave it the same for this example but you can have the same abilit name as 
		long as it has a different category name. For example: CATEGORY:Ambush could contain 
		'FooBarSneak' and then you could have CATEGORY:Rogue with 'FooBarSneak'</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>PLURAL:STs</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This has to do with the 
		internationalization. An example is: in_feats which sets the Category key to 
		'in_feats'. &lt;Tir can you add anything to this?&gt; </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>EDITABLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This defines whether a user 
		can modify the abilities in the category. NO would be appropriate for class 
		abilities which aren't chosen by the user.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>EDITPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This defines whether a user 
		can modify the pool number or not. Each ability has a 'cost' (Default is 1) if 
		this option is set to 'NO' the user cannot add or subtract from the pool.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>FRACTIONALPOOL:NO</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This defines whether the pool 
		must be a whole number or can be fractions. Some abilities may have a cost less 
		than '1' like .5 or .25.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>POOL:STPool</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This is a formula to determine 
		the pool number. Example: TL/2 would grant one point every 2 levels to the character.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> Defines whether this category 
		is visible on the UI or hidden. Usefull for hidden abilities and class abilities 
		that require no interaction from the user.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>Statsandchecks.lst File</h3>
	
	<p>The following tags are added to the line defining the intelligence stat.</p>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>DEFINE:STMax|TL/2</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This tag is used to define the variable 
		&quot;STMax&quot; to have a value of half the character's total level.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="indent1">You will find the modified <a href="#STATSANDSCHECKS">Intellegence Stat</a> below.</p>

<hr>

		<h3>Skills.lst File</h3>
		
		<p class="indent1">ST Skill</p>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>TYPE:NoStat</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> We are defining what 'type' 
		this skill belongs to. You can use any type that you feel appropriate.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>VISIBLE:DISPLAY</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> 'DISPLAY' - This skill will 
		only be visible in the GUI of PCGen on not appear on the Character sheet.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|ST|SKILL.ST Skill.RANK</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> Breaking down the tag we are 
		saying to give a bonus to the ABILITYPOOL of the ST category for each skill rank 
		placed in the skill. Note: Each skill rank cost 2 points as a Cross-Class Skill.</p>
	</blockquote>

<hr>

		<h3>Ability.lst File</h3>
		
		<p class="indent1">(showing one ST specifically, adjust PRExxx to be appropriate...) </p>

		<p class="indent1">Note the &quot;!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ST,Ac Ba&quot;... this keeps the ability from showing up for choosing after you have already taken it. This is a temporary workaround as there is currently a bug with the ability object not respecting the default of MULT:NO): </p>
	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>CATEGORY:ST</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This places the ability named in the 'ST' category. Remember we can use the same name, but you must use a different category. NOTE: This category must have been defined in the miscinfo.lst file to be valid.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>TYPE:ST.Movement</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> We have a period '.' delimiter to give the ability more than one 'type'. In this case we have 'ST' as a 'type' and we are placing this Ability under the 'Movement' type.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>VISIBLE:YES</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> Setting the visible to YES (which is default) allows the user to see this on the GUI in PCGen.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=ST,Ac Ba</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This a PRE-Requisite tag, it determines whether the character qualifies for the Ability. The '!' exclamation mark preceeding the tag tells PCGen that the opposite is to be observed. In our first PRExxx tag, the character cannot have this ability already; CATEGORY=ST,&lt;Skill Name&gt; So I cannot have Ac Ba in the ST category already on my character to qualify. The PRESKILL says I must have x ranks in the skill. '1' indicates how many skills I must meet, and the Skill=x, sets how many ranks I must have in the skill. PREVARLT says that I must have less STCount than the STMax. If we remember STMax was defined as half my character level, and as we see further down the line STCount is a new defined tag, which will increase by one each time I grab an ability.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>PRESKILL:1,Tumble=12</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This a PRE-Requisite tag, it determines whether the character qualifies for the Ability.

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>DEFINE:STCount|0</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This tag is used to define the variable 
		'STCount' and to initialize it to the value zero.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>DESC:&lt;appropriate description&gt;</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This is where you type the text you want to appear with your chosen ability. This will be displayed on the character sheet UNLESS the ability is set to NO or DISPLAY. In that case you would skip this tag and may instead use SA: in it's place. That tag is discussed in another lesson.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote class="indent1">
		<p class="indent0"><strong>Tag Used:</strong> <code>BONUS:VAR|STCount|1</code></p>
		<p class="indent1"><strong>What it Does:</strong> This bonus tag is increasing the 'VAR'iable of STCount by 1 each time it is chosen.</p>
