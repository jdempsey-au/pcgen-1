		<h1>Game Rules Implementation</h1>
		
		<p>This section is designed to provide a series of rules implementation explanations. 
		The game rules implementations have been organized in two sections. The first section 
		includes those rules that have been implemented as part of the officially distributed 
		datasets from PCGen while the second section includes rules implementation sulotions 
		aimed at Homebrew datasets. For more general information on writing standard LST files 
		please visit the <a href="../lstfileclass/lstfileclass_heading.html">LST File Class</a> page.</p>

		<p>The rules implementation solutions represented below are not the only way to implement the subject  
		rules.  They are given here simply as examples of how different rules can be implmented.</p>


		<h4>Conventions</h4>
		<p class="indent1">Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate what you would see in a LST 
  		file we are going to use certain conventions to convey these ideas. Tags in 
  		LST files are tab delineated, that is the tags are separated by tabs. because 
  		this is difficult to show the tag examples in the LST classes here will be separated 
  		by line breaks. Text meant to display LST code will be in the <code>code font</code> 
  		like so. Text taken from a source will be indicated in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
		
  		<h4>Game Rules Implementations Included with PCGen Distributed Datasets</h4>

 		<dd>Equipment/Items can now bestow negative levels upon a character.</dd>
		</dl>
		
  		<h4>Game Rules Implementations for Homebrew Datasets</h4>
		<dl class="indent1">
