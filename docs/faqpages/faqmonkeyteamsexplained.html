		<h1>PCGen Monkey Teams Explained</h1>
		
		<p class="bolditalicunderline">who does what?</p>
		
		<p>In the &quot;About&quot; box of PCGen, you'll quickly notice the PCGen has 
  		a monkey meme. I chose &quot;Chief Code Monkey&quot; as my title when I first 
  		made PCGen available to the public, and I later adopted the title of Benevolent 
  		Dictator. Other teams formed to focus on different aspects of PCGen, and all 
  		have taken to referring to themselves as monkeys. In the About box we try to 
  		list everyone who has contributed to PCGen in chronological order, and the monkeys 
  		are grouped into Code, Content, Test and Engineering.</p>

		<p class="bolditalicunderline">Here's a primer on what each team does, see the 
  		<a href="../acknowledgments/bod.html">Board of Directors</a> page for a list 
  		of those in charge of each team:</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Code Monkeys</strong><br>
  		This team works on the java code. Their trackers are located at pcgen.sf.net.</p>
		
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Content</strong><br>
  		This team encompasses all content published with PCGen. This includes Data, Docs and Output Sheets.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Data Monkeys</strong><br>
  		The Data Monkeys work on the data for all the books you load in PCGen. They help answer 
  		data questions at the PCGenListFileHelp. They have pcgen_experimental group 
  		where they actually work on the different books we're trying to get into PCGen. 
  		Their trackers are located at pcgendm.sf.net.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Doc Monkeys</strong><br>
  		The Doc Monkeys work on the documentation. Their trackers are located at pcgendocs.sf.net.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Output Sheet Monkeys (OS Monkeys)</strong><br>
  		The Output Sheet Monkeys work on the output sheets which are used to export to character sheets 
  		in PCGen. These templates involve xml, xsl and html. Their trackers are located 
  		at pcgendocs.sf.net.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Quality Assurance Monkeys (QA Monkeys)</strong><br>
  		This team works on testing PCGen to make sure the releases are reliable and 
  		high quality. They have a yahoo group called pcgenqa where they discuss what 
		they're doing.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Publisher Liason Monkeys</strong><br>
  		This team servers as the contact for all the publishers. This way all contact 
  		with publishers can be more easily managed and consistent.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>OGL Monkeys</strong><br>
  		This team is named after the OpenGamingLicense that made the popularity of 3e 
  		possible. This team makes sure that all material included in PCGen meets any 
  		license requirements (not just the OGL).</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Tracker Monkeys</strong><br>
  		This is the team that monitors the pcgen yahoo site for bug reports and feature 
  		requests. They also prioritize all trackers submitted at the three sourceforge 
  		sites.</p>

		<p class="bolditalicunderline">More Detailed Listing of what each team does:</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Code Monkeys</strong><br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Java (any amount) <br>
  		Some code monkeys work on the interface (GUI), some work on the engine (business 
  		logic), some work on optimizations and others perform routine maintenance. All 
  		levels of java (even newbie) are accepted and if you've got the time, we've 
  		got plenty to do! There is a Developer's Forum where questions from really basic 
  		to very advanced can be asked. I'm generally happy to let people work on the 
  		section of code that most interests (or irritates!) them, though I ask that 
  		all developers help out with the priority 9 trackers (bugs or feature requests 
  		at pcgen.sf.net) since that's what has been deemed to be necessary for the next 
  		production release of PCGen.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Data Monkeys</strong> <br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Accurate typing, preferably some amount of experience 
  		with a computer language of any kind <br>
  		Newbie data monkeys are generally asked to do an initial swipe on a book. Most 
  		data monkeys develop a mastery of one area of data (like classes or feats or 
  		races), and as they advance they are asked to check the work of other newbie 
  		data monkeys. All work currently is done in a proprietary data language called 
  		LST (after the adopted extensions of all the data files) and most of it is pretty 
  		easy to pick up. There are some bits of it that are more difficult to master, 
  		and data gurus are highly prized. :) As data is worked on, it's uploaded to 
  		pcgen_experimental so the OGL and Publisher teams can check them. Once a source 
  		is completed and checked, it's added to the PCGen releases.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Doc Monkeys </strong><br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Ability to describe clearly how to use software and to 
  		present it in an appealing manner. <br>
  		The Documentation team is responsible for making sure that the screen pics are 
  		up-to-date and that the descriptions of how to use the interface makes PCGen 
  		understandable for first-time users. They also update the documentation on the 
  		LST language to help data monkeys do their work. The documentation is done in html.</p>
		
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Output Sheet Monkeys </strong><br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Familiarity with xml/xsl/htm, preferably some java <br>
  		Some OS Monkeys work in xml/xsl, and others work in html. It's helpful if they 
  		also know java so they can look at the code of PCGen itself to better understand 
  		(and even modify) what it's doing when it outputs a character sheet. </p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Quality Assurance Monkeys</strong><br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Ability to describe steps to reliably reproduce a bug, 
  		preferably some professional QA experience but not required <br>
  		This team develops regression tests to make sure that code changes in PCGen 
  		don't break anything that was working. They also help test the interface to 
  		make sure that it works as expected. They also help try to determine where and 
  		when PCGen slows down or runs into trouble so the Code Monkey team can resolve 
  		the problem and improve PCGen's performance. As the QA team discovers issues, 
  		it enters the bug in the appropriate place (pcgen.sf.net for code bugs, pcgendm.sf.net 
  		for data bugs, pcgendocs.sf.net for doc or OS bugs).</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Special Project Monkeys</strong> <br>
  		This team is used intermittently based solely upon need and generally consists 
  		of a combination of code and data monkeys.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Publisher Liason Monkeys</strong> <br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Desire to communicate to publishers and ability to communicate clearly <br>
  		Since this group is our contact point with all publishers, it's a small group.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>OGL Monkeys </strong><br>
  		<em>Requirements:</em> Ability to understand and explain licenses like the OGL, 
  		LGPL and other licenses with which PCGen must comply. <br>
  		This team checks all data to make sure that it complies with the <a href="../acknowledgments/ogllicense.html">
		OpenGamingLicense</a>, the <a href="../acknowledgments/gnulicense.html">Lesser GPL</a> 
		and any other licenses that apply to PCGen. Any issues found are immediately reported - 
		to pcgen_experimental if it's a data issue, to pcgen.sf.net if it's a code issue.</p>

		<p class="indent1"><strong>Tracker Monkeys</strong> <br>
  		This is the team that monitors the pcgen yahoo group for bug and feature requests. 
 		Any bugs that are confirmed are entered as a tracker in the appropriate group's 
  		list (code items at pcgen.sf.net, data items at pcgendm.sf.net, output sheet 
  		and documentation items at pcgendocs.sf.net). After the confirm/reject a report, 
  		they respond to the user's post to indicate the tracker number or to indicate 
  		that they couldn't reproduce it. Some trackers help monitor the Files folders 
  		where users can upload character files that exhibit a bug they're reporting. 
  		Other trackers help monitor all items submitted to the various groups and make 
  		sure they're not duplicates, and adjust the priority on the item according to 
  		the list of rules supplied by the Board of Directors.</p>
		
		<p class="indent1">Tracker priority ranks</p>
		
		<p class="indent2">
			P9 = Emergency! fix me NOW. This priority is reserved for crashes and other issues which block usability.<br>
  			P7 = Next production release.<br>
  			P5 = Production release after that.<br>
  			P3 = Default priority.<br>
  			P1 = Low priority.</p>

		<p class="indent1">How this all works:</p>

		<p class="indent1">Scenario 1 - A user submits a bug report <br>
  		Suppose someone submits something like this to the pcgen yahoo group: &quot;[BUG] 
  		5.7.2 - My Fighter's BAB is 0!&quot;. A Tracker Monkey monitoring the group 
  		attempts to confirm the bug with the version specified. If no version is specified, 
  		simply try the most recent version. If the bug can be confirmed, try it in the 
  		most recent production release to see if it was a problem there. If it's a code-related 
  		issue, submit a bug report at pcgen.sf.net and indicate whether or not it's 
  		a bug in the most recent production release as well as the version specified. 
  		If it's a data-related bug, follow the same process at pcgendm.sf.net. If it's 
  		a bug in a production release, it gets assigned priority 9. Then respond to 
  		the user's post at the yahoo group with the tracker number. If you cannot confirm 
  		the bug, respond to the user's post and let them know what you tried. Request 
  		more information if it isn't clear what steps the user took. If the tracker 
  		was submitted to pcgen.sf.net, a code monkey would work on the item and mark 
  		it as closed once the code for it has been checked in. A data monkey would do 
  		the same thing for anything submitted to pcgendm.sf.net.</p>

		<p class="indent1">Scenario 2 - QA finds something <br>
  		A QA monkey testing PCGen comes across an issue. This is reported to the pcgenqa 
  		yahoo group so others can confirm it. Once it's confirmed, one of the QA monkeys 
  		or one of the tracker monkeys can submit the bug in either pcgen.sf.net or pcgendm.net. 
  		It then follows the same process as scenario 1.</p>
		
		<p class="indent1"><strong>Note:</strong> Tracker can mean two things. It can refer to a member 
  		of the Tracker Monkey team, it can also refer to an item that has been submitted 
  		either as a bug report or feature request at a sourceforge site. Sourceforge, 
  		also referred to as SF, calls these list of reports as Trackers. This way bug 
  		reports and feature requests don't get lost and is a primary way we act on the 
  		feedback we receive from our users.</p>

		<p>If you have time and talent, which team should you join? All the teams are 
  		always looking for new people to join. It's understood that there's a learning 
  		curve for anyone new, but we were all there once so we're all glad to help mentor 
  		any willing volunteers. PCGen is a lot of fun because it helps make our games 
  		more manageable and because the teams get along so well. If you get tired of 
  		one team, it's no problem to switch to another. If you're not sure which team 
  		to join and you think you fit the needs for a few of them - let us know and 
  		we'll be glad to put you wherever the most dire need currently resides.</p>
