		<h1>Out of Memory Issues</h1>


				<p><span class="underline">How do I increase my memory?</span></p>

				<p>For Windows Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Try edit the pcgen.bat file and assign more memory to pcgen, this means changing the <code>-Xmx</code> option:<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code>java -jar pcgen.jar <strong>-Xmx512m</strong></code>
					<br><br>
					This assigns 512Mb of RAM and should be enough memory for pcgen to run with lots of sources loaded.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For Mac Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>First, launch a Terminal window. That gives you a command line. Yeah, I know... a Unix
						command line on a Mac... it creeped me out the first time. ;-)</li>

					<li>From the command line, cd to the directory where your PCGen install lives.
						Then launch java to run PCGen with the memory-adding parameters. It's the
						same syntax as running it on a PC from the command line. Something like:<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code># java -Xms 128M -Xmx 512M -jar pcgen.jar</code>
					<br><br>
					(That may not be quite right, but something like that. You might have a
						machine handy where you can verify the syntax.)
					<br><br>
					It has the added benefit that you get to see any error messages which are
					directed to the console (stdout or stderr), which can be a big help in
					debugging LST files.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For Unix Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Refer to Mac instructions</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
				<p>For All Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Don't load sources that you don't need.</li>

					<li>In Preferences - Don't auto create equipment, use the provided equipment and custom
					create equipment as needed. To custom create, right click on the basic equipement and add to
					it.</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>

<h1>Java Issues</h1>


			<p></p>
				<p><span class="underline">What Java do I need?</span></p>

                <p>"PCGen 5.12.x and above needs Java 1.5.x or Java 1.6.0_01 (and above)"<br /></p>
				<p>"PCGen 5.10.2 and below needs Java 1.5.x"<br /></p>
				<p>"PCGen 5.8.1 and below needs Java 1.4.x"<br /></p>
				<p>"PCGen 5.6.1 and below needs Java 1.3.x"<br /></p>






				<p><span class="underline">How do I find my Java?</span></p>

				<p>"Not good.  Im getting "Bad command or file name"<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Sounds like you don't have java installed then. Go to <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>
						and download and install the latest java 1.5.x JRE. You'll then be able to run PCGen.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For Windows Users:<br /></p>
				<ul>
					<li>First question is, do you have java installed on your machine. If you don't know, go the
					command prompt and type:<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code>java -version</code>
					<p></p>
					<li>You should get some kind of a response like:<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code>java version "1.5.0_06"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
                    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)</code>
				</ul>

				<p>For Mac Users:<br /></p>
				<ul>
					<li>What Java run-time environment (JRE) are you running? (I think I already know the
					answer, but asking anyway.) From a command line (open a Terminal window), enter:<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code># java -version</code>
				<p></p>
					<li>You should get some kind of a response like:<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					<code>java version "1.5.0_06"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
					Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160
                    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)</code>
				</ul>

				<p>For Unix Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Refer to Mac instructions</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For Fedora Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>I can't run pcgen on fedora 7. It crashes just after the options directory selection.</li>

					<li>PCGen does not run under licgcj (GNU's Java library) because it is incomplete (it is
					not a complete implementation of Java, especially with respect to Swing (the UI))</li>

					<li>You need to download a complete Java implementation, such as that from Sun
					Microsystems (available at <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>)</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
				<p>For Ubuntu Users:<br /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>The #1 issue for PCGen and Ubuntu is that you need to use the Sun Java implementation,
					not the default that ships with Ubuntu. We have detailed instructions in one of the closed
					support requests if you need those (just search for Ubuntu when in the support requests
					list at PCGen's SF site at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=25576">SourceForge.net PCGen An RPG Character Generator Tracker</a>).</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>You need to run sun java. You can check this with:
					<br><br>
					$ java -version
					<br><br>
					If not, you might need to install Sun JRE from the repositories (see the Ubuntu wiki for
					help)
					<br><br>
					If Sun java is installed but not run, you need to update the default java by using:
					<br><br>
					$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
					<br><br>
					or
					<br><br>
					$ sudo update-alternatives --set \java /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/bin/java
					<br><br>
					I think both these command do the same thing (with the first command you get a list of
					possible java's and are asked to choose).
					<br><br>
					Manually moving files and placing symbolic links might get the job done but is probably bad
					for the long-term health of your system. I think things might break with an update.</li>
					<br><br>
					<li>You need to download a complete Java implementation, such as that from Sun
					Microsystems (available at <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>)</li>
