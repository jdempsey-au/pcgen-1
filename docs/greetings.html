		<h1>Welcome to PCGen!</h1>

		<p>The name implies that PCGen is just for generating PCs - which it does - but
		the fact that it lets you do that with just about any book published so far
		makes it useful for creating NPCs as well! Our goal is to support all RPG
		material produced and to make it easy for users to enter their own material. We
		also recognize that just about everyone has house rules and we've added support
		for many of these variations. For example, some GMs let their players purchase
		ranks in exclusive skills, but at a higher cost than cross-class skills. PCGen
		lets you set the cost for exclusive skills to accommodate this. We support a
		good number of options like this. </p>

		<p>Our goal to support every RPG book is very ambitious, and considering the
		amount of material out there you'd think we need an army to make it happen! The
		good news is that we do have an army - our command center is our Yahoo Message
		board located at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen</a>
		where we meet to discuss who is tackling what sources, what functionality needs to be done before a
		source is completely supportable, answer questions (newbie questions are
		welcomed!), discuss potential bugs and refine new functionality requests. We
		strive hard to make PCGen useful to gamers and have it do as much of the dirty
		work involved in creating a character as possible, while at the same time
		balancing that with the publisher's need for sales. Put simply, we want PCGen to
		be useful to gamers and at the same time not put anyone out of business.
		Obviously if we were to endanger any publisher's source of revenue they wouldn't
		be very happy with us. Fortunately we've found a good balance and the publishers
		are very satisfied.</p>

		<p>How do we manage this? Basically we include in PCGen's data files only enough
		information to create a character but we curtail the descriptions to be just
		summaries. This means that you can see that there's a class called Kickyourbutt,
		and if you advance to 4th level in it you'll see that your base attack bonus is
		+12 and you can use a special ability called &quot;Kick Anyone's Butt (x4)&quot;. What you
		won't see is a description of the class and any rituals involved in becoming a
		member of this class, or how that special ability works - if you want to know
		the details you'll need the book. Effectively this means that PCGen is meant for
		all the &quot;crunchy bits&quot; in a book, and all the flavor text remains in the book.
		If you have the book, Kick Anyone's Butt (x4) is enough for you to know what you
		can do - and if you don't have that book, seeing that as an option might make
		you want to go take a closer look at that book and buy it. There lies the magic
		of PCGen - it's not only extremely useful for generating characters using books
		you own, but you can create characters with books you don't own. This is akin to
		flipping through the book at the bookstore, except you brought your dice and a
		character sheet with you! This way the publishers get free marketing through
		PCGen - they can reach gamers who might not otherwise have heard of them or
		their book. So both gamers and game publishers win. </p>

		<p>PCGen is open source and therefore free. We have a lot of developers who
		donate their time to work on this labor of love - these are the Code Monkeys
		listed in the About window within PCGen. Since PCGen is written in java it works
		on any computer which can run java - which is almost all of them! We also have a
		lot of List Monkeys who generously donate their time to work on the data files.
		We're always looking for new recruits, if you'd like to help complete the
		conversion of a certain book, or you'd like to see a book added that we haven't
		included yet, let us know at the aforementioned yahoo message board. Creating
		the data-files is fairly easy and we're always glad to help train new monkeys!
		We're endeavoring to make it so you can add and modify the data from within
		PCGen itself, but at the moment editing the data files is done with your
		favorite text editor (WordPad, Edit and even VI!). </p>

		<p>PCGen began in October of 2000 as my own personal project - both to teach
		myself java and as an aid to help convert my high-level campaign from 1ed to 3e.
		Just for fun I put it on the net and was amazed when others wanted to get
		involved. Things quickly picked up and the pace has never slackened. It's been a
		lot of fun and very rewarding to see how its progressed. As the Benevolent
		Dictator of PCGen I am extremely thrilled at how much time others have put into
		it. The product you have before you is the result of nearly 4 years of
		continuous effort on the part of many people. This has a strong community effort
		behind it and the plans I have for it are even more expansive than just
		character generation and maintenance - but more on that later. :)<br />
