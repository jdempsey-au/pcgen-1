		<h1>Character Output Sheets</h1>
		
		<p>The most important aspect of any character generator is the 
		final output, without that, the generator is pretty useless! So explained 
		in the next few sections are the character sheets provided with PCGen. 
		There are three types of output sheets; Character Sheets, Party Sheets, &amp; 
		Equipment Set Sheets, and 3 styles of output; HTML, PDF, &amp; XML.</p>
		
		<p>The Most used are the Character Sheets, well, it IS a character 
		generator after all! These come in HTML, PDF, &amp; for OpenRPG, an XML sheet!</p>
		
		<p>Party Sheets are primarily for use by the Game Master, they 
		contain condensed information on the entire party for quick reference and these 
		come in HTML and PDF formats</p>
		
		<p>Equipment Set sheets are used to allow players to configure 
		different 'dress' depending on the environment they are in. The can set up 
		for the classic dungeon crawl, meeting the prince, or their 'in town' set of 
		items worn. </p>
