		<h1>House Rules Menu Options</h1>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="../../../images/preferences/houserules.png" alt="House Rules Menu Options" width="597" height="516" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>House Rules</strong> option allows certain house rules to be applied. These are customizable rules 
		that are not the default guidelines established by the Players Rules. The checkmark by each option 
		signifies that it is selected to be used for PC creation.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cross-class Skill Cost</strong> determines the value of taking a skill that you is not part of 
		your class. Normally the default is 2, this option allows you to choose: <strong>0,1,2. </strong>This is the 
		cost in skill points to take a skill that is a cross-skill for your class. This menu expands out to 
		allow the choice between 0, 1, or 2.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Allow any range for ability scores</strong> allows for ability scores below 8 and above 18, 
		specifically using the optional Point Buy system. Unchecked one cannot create a point buy method outside the 
		ranges of 8 and 18. Please note that you must check this box, close the preferences and open them back up again 
		before you can create a point buy method of any range..</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Add stat bonus to spells known</strong> adds to a characters number of spells known using the
		Table:Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells. Normally characters with a limited number of spells known such as 
		Bards and Sorcerers do not get bonus spells known due to high ability scores.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Bypass Class Prerequisites</strong> allows the user to ignore the prerequisites for a class 
		and allows them to qualify for any class available regardless of what the material allows.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Treat Weapons In Hand As Equipped For Attacks</strong> option allows all weapons that are merely 
		listed as 'equipped' but no in hand in the inventory of the character to be calculated as if the item 
		were equipped in hand.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Bypass Feat Prerequisites</strong> allows the user to ignore the prerequisites for a feat.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ask For Free Clothing at First Level</strong> presents the user with a pop-up when first 
		creating the PC asking the user to select a free set of clothing for the PC to wear. 
		Deselecting this option will prevent the pop-up from appearing. This feature is hardcoded to use the 
		equipment type &quot;Starting&quot; which has been added to qualifying clothing.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Increment STAT before calculating skills points before leveling</strong> allows the user to 
		decide if skill points are determined before or after a character gets their increase in stat (in 
		regards to Intelligence modifying skill points earned)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Allow Selection of Int bonus Languages after 1st level</strong> allows a character to choose 
		additional bonus languages past first level if the characters INT score increaces.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Ignore Level Cap</strong> will allow the user to exceed the maximum level as defined in the data 
		class files.</p>

		<p>The <strong>Bypass Maximum Skill Rank</strong> allows the user to ignore the maximum level for their skills 
		(3+level) and take as many points in any skill as they wish.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Apply Load Penalty to AC and Skills</strong> sets the appropriate penalties when a PC's carried 
		equipment changes from normal to light, medium, or heavy load. This option affects all the penalties 
		going along with having the appropriate load as determined in the Players Rules. Not selecting this option will 
		allow the PC to have no adverse affects when equipping a heavier load than allowed.</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Apply Weight Penalty to Skills</strong> is similar to the <strong>Apply load penalty to AC and skills</strong> 
		option but only applies the weight penalty to skills and not AC. Deselecting this penalty will remove 
		all penalties with weight to affect the appropriate skills as determined in the Players Rules.</p>
		
		<p>The 3.5 revision of the rules significantly changed the way weapon sizes were handled within the game. 
		The <strong>Use 3.5 Weapon Categories / Use 3.0 Weapon Sizes</strong> choice allows the user to choose which 
		version of the Weapons size rules to use within PCGen.</p>
