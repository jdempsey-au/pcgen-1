		<p>The <strong>Display Options</strong> menu option will allow you to:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Show Tooltips Text</strong>.  Shows different tips on what each screen, tab, and option does. It displays helpful 
			hints and guides for what each part of PCGen does when the mouse cursor is on top of an option. Deselecting this 
			option will cause the tips to not be displayed.</li>

			<li><strong>Show the Toolbar</strong>.  This allows the user to have a toolbar beneath the menus to help provide quick one 
			click solutions to common tasks within PCGen such as: save, print, open folder, etc. If this option is deselected 
			than the toolbar will not appear beneath the menus.</li>

			<li><strong>Use Automatic Busy Cursor</strong>.  Displayed whenever PCGen is busy performing a task.</li>

			<li><strong>Display &quot;OutputName&quot; for items</strong>. This is for displaying specially named items that you create.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Display Feat Description</strong>.  This sets the  description field to display the short &quot;flavor text&quot; 
			of the feat rather than the longer benefit text. If there is no benefit text it will display the short description.</li>

			<li><strong>Chooser single choice behavior</strong>, e.g.  You gain an ability for level x, this
			ability is the only one you can choose in the chooser, so you have the choice of the chooser automatically
			selecting that item and the user manually closing it, the chooser selecting the item and closing itself or
			complete manual intervention by the user. You should use caution when using this feature as it can have unintended 
			and unexpected behaviors. For example, with this feature turned on if you choose the feat Toughness the program will select 
			the one choice offered for as many times as you have feat points left in your feat pool. Further more you cannot remove 
			these feat choices until this feature is deselected.</li>
		</ul>
