		<p class="center"><img src="../../../images/editors/deity/languagestab.png" alt="Deity Editor: Languages Tab" width="648" height="494" /></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>Languages</strong> tab is used to define which languages are granted to the
		follower of the deity.</p>
		
		<p>The two <strong>Granted Languages </strong>windows, <strong>Available </strong>and <strong>Selected </strong>are used to create 
		a list of languages granted to the deity's followers.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The language names in the <strong>Available</strong> window are drawn from whichever sources were loaded into 
			PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then languages from both sources 
			will appear in the window.)</li>
			
			<li>The <strong>Add</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons will move the highlighted language between the 2 windows, 
			as will double clicking on a language name in either window.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The <strong>Cancel</strong> and <strong>Save </strong>buttons, which appear on every tab, are used to either cancel the 
		deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst file.</p>
