    <h1>Creating a FreeMarker Output Sheet</h1>

	<p>FreeMarker sheets are detected by PCGen by their file name suffix. A 
	template ending in <b>.ftl</b> will be processed by FreeMarker rather than by 
	PCGen's legacy output engine. </p>
	<p>The extension of the file to be produced 
	should be immediately before that and preceded by a . or -. So a template 
	to produce html output might be named csheet-first.html.ftl or 
	chseet-compact-html.ftl and PCGen would pick up that it was a template to be 
	processed by FreeMarker template that would produce output of a html file. </p>

	<p>Inside the sheet, the file is just a text file, with functions or directives 
	included when needed to produce dynamic output. It is often simplest to start 
	with a static file that looks like the output you want and then gradually 
	introduce FreeMarker tags to make the sheet show the character info.

	<h3>FreeMarker Documentation</h3>
	<p>FreeMarker has quite thorough documentation. The main references output sheet authors will use are:
	</p>
	<ol><li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://freemarker.org/docs/dgui.html">Template Author's Guide</a>
	</li><li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://freemarker.org/docs/ref.html">Reference Guide</a>
	</li><li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://freemarker.org/">Main FreeMarker page</a>
	</li></ol>
	<p>In addition, see testsuite/base-xml.ftl for a fully worked example of xml output.</p>

	<h3>Conversion from Legacy Output Engine</h3>
	<p>In the future a script may be provided to convert a legacy PCGen sheet to FreeMarker. In 
	the meantime, the following main steps will need to be done manually:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Replace each old tag with a call to @pcstring. e.g. |PLAYERNAME| becomes &lt;@pcstring tag="PLAYERNAME"/&gt;</li>
		<li>Replace loop variables in tags with variable references. e.g. |CLASSABB.%class| becomes &lt;@pcstring tag="CLASSABB.${class}"/&gt;</li>
		<li>Replace FOR loops with @loop directives. e.g. |FOR,%class,0,COUNT[CLASSES]-1,1,0| 
		becomes &lt;@loop from=0 to=pcvar('count("CLASSES")')-1 ; class , class_has_next &gt;</li>
		<li>Replace IF tests with FreeMarker if tests. This will often need the use of pcvar and pcboolean functions to access character information.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Manual tidy up will then be required including extracting repeated content to macros.</p>
