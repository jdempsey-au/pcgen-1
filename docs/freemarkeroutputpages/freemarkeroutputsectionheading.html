    <h1>FreeMarker Output Support</h1>

    <p>Starting from version 6.03.00, PCGen has introduced support for the 
    <a href="http://freemarker.org/">FreeMarker</a> template engine. FreeMarker
    is a tool to allow the generation of text files based on templates. </p>
    <p>FreeMarker brings a powerful, rich language for the creation of output 
    sheets to PCGen. It has far greater capabilities than were provided by PCGen's
    venerable output sheet language. These include the ability to define macros and 
    methods to include repeated content as well as understandable looping and logic
    commands.</p>
    <p>The initial implementation of FreeMarker for PCGen provides all of the 
    capabilities of the old output sheet system with a series of functions to access 
    the old output sheet tokens. In the future we will also provide an object based 
    means of interacting with a character being output. This will allow more 
    flexible and data driven output.</p>
