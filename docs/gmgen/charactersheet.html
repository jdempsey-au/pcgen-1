One advantage the GMGen character   		sheet has over the exported sheets is that changes made to the character in   		PCGen are updated automatically at the time you make them. So, for example,   		if you were to apply the Rage bonuses from the Temporary Bonus Tab you would   		see these changes applied to your character when you returned to the GMGen character sheet.</p>		<p>The tabs on the left allow you to navigate through the pages of the character 		sheet. Page contains the primary information such as name, ability scores, skills,   		hit points, etc.. Page 2 contains additional information such as Feats and Special   		Abilities. If your character is a spellcaster there will be additional pages   		displaying your spells. If multiple characters are loaded the names of the characters   		will appear on tabs at the bottom of the character sheet allowing you to switch   		between characters.</p>		<p>The accent color of the character sheet can be changed in the <a href="preferences.html#DISPLAY">GMGen Preferences</a>.</p>						<p class="center"><img src="../images/gmgen/plugins/charactersheet/charactersheet1.png"></p>				<p class="center"><img src="../images/gmgen/plugins/charactersheet/charactersheet2.png"></p>				<p class="center"><img src="../images/gmgen/plugins/charactersheet/charactersheet3.png"></p>			</body></html>
