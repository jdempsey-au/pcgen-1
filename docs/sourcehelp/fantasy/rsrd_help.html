	<p>The (Revised) System Reference Document, or RSRD, contain the core rules for the d20 fantasy 
	  role playing game published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming License 
	  and contain much of the material found in the three core books and the Psionics 
	  supplement.</p>
		
	<h2>Loading the RSRD</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1">To load the RSRD set you have two options, you can load the 3.5 RSRD Complete set 
	or you can load the 3.5 RSRD Basics set and any of the other Partial 3.5 RSRD sets. 
	You should not load the 3.5 RSRD Complete set and any of the Partial sets at the same time 
	because it is basically loading the same data twice. 
	If you load any of the Partial sets keep in mind that the 3.5 RSRD Basics set is required for any of the other Partial sets.</p>
	
	<h2>Class Features</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Arcane Archer</strong></p>
	
	<p class="indent1">The Arcane Archer has the ability to enchant any non-magical arrow notched in his bow. 
	This feature cannot be automatically enabled in PCGen. To have the effects of this feature activated 
	you must customize a non-magical arrow with the Arcane Archer Enhancement equipment modifier. 
	Ammo with this EQMOD applied to it and loaded in a bow will display the proper bonuses for the Arcane Archers level. 
	A PC with no levels of Arcane Archer will gain no benefit.</p>
	
	<h2>Domains</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1">Some Domains grant Casterlevel bonuses to spells of Certain Schools, Subschools or Descriptors 
	as detailed in the Domains description. These bonuses are not active by default because of a limitation within PCGen. 
	Domains are class abilities and the casterlevel bonuses should only apply to spells granted from the same class granting the Domain. 
	PCGen cannot limit this and will apply a bonus to any qualifying spell regardless of what class it comes from. 
	For example if you create a Cleric/Wizard with the Knowledge Domain it would grant a +1 Casterlevel bonus to all Divination spells Cleric and Wizard alike. 
	We have provided a way to activate these bonuses, Under Settings -> Preferences -> House Rules 
	you will find the rule "Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from Domains to Spells". 
	Checking this box will activate these bonuses. 
	Note that if your character does not have spells from other classes you will not be breaking any rules</p>
	
	<p class="indent1">Some Domains grant certain skills as class skills, be aware that these class skills are applied to the Cleric class only.</p>
	
	<h2>Templates</h2>
	
	<p class="indent1"><strong>Awakened Animal</strong></p>
	
	<p class="indent1">The Awakened Animal template can be applied to any animal on which the spell Awaken has been cast. 
	All the effects of the spell are implemented including the random stat adjustments to the Animals Intelligence and Charisma. 
	However if you remove the template the stats will not revert back, you will need to manually back to where they were. 
	You will also need to remove the language added by the template and any skill points spent on skill ranks.</p>
