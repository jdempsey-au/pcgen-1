To have the effects of this feature activated 	you must customize a non-magical arrow with the Arcane Archer Enhancement equipment modifier. 	Ammo with this EQMOD applied to it and loaded in a bow will display the proper bonuses for the Arcane Archers level. 	A PC with no levels of Arcane Archer will gain no benefit.</p>		<h2>Domains</h2>		<p class="indent1">Some Domains grant Casterlevel bonuses to spells of Certain Schools, Subschools or Descriptors 	as detailed in the Domains description. These bonuses are not active by default because of a limitation within PCGen. 	Domains are class abilities and the casterlevel bonuses should only apply to spells granted from the same class granting the Domain. 	PCGen cannot limit this and will apply a bonus to any qualifying spell regardless of what class it comes from. 	For example if you create a Cleric/Wizard with the Knowledge Domain it would grant a +1 Casterlevel bonus to all Divination spells Cleric and Wizard alike. 	We have provided a way to activate these bonuses, Under Settings -> Preferences -> House Rules 	you will find the rule "Apply Casterlevel Bonuses from Domains to Spells". 	Checking this box will activate these bonuses. 	Note that if your character does not have spells from other classes you will not be breaking any rules</p>	</body></html>
