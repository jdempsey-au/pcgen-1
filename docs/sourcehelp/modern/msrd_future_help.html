	<h1>Modern System Reference Document - Future section help file</h1>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>Game Mode: Modern</strong></p>

	<p class="indent1">MSRD &gt; PARTIAL</p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>Future - Basics</strong></p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>Future - Cybernetics</strong></p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>Future - Mutations</strong></p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>Future - Robots</strong></p>

	<p class="indent1">To run this you also need to load one of these:</p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>MSRD &gt; Complete &gt; Modern</strong></p>
	<p class="indent2"><strong>MSRD &gt; Partial &gt; Modern - Basic</strong></p>

	<p>The Future section of the Modern System Reference Document, or MSRD, contains the Future rules for the
	  Modern d20 role playing game published by Wizards of the Coast under the Open Gaming License and contains
	  much of the material found in the Future supplement.</p>

	<h2>Loading the MSRD Future parts</h2>

	<p class="indent1">To load the MSRD Future set you also need to load the MSRD Basics. You have two options
	to accomplish this, either you can load the MSRD Complete set (including FX, Creatures, and Menaces material)
	or you can load the MSRD Basics set and maybe add some of the other Partial Modern sets to that.
	To that selection you add those parts of the MSRD Future section you desire to use. Future - Basics contains almost
	all classes, feats, and occupations, Future - Equipment includes equipment, starships, and vehicles, the other names
	should be self-explanatory.</p>

	<h1>Future - Basics</h1>

	<h2>Feats</h2>

	<p class="indent1"><strong>PLUS Feats</strong></p>
	<p class="indent1">The feats <i>Charismatic Plus</i>, <i>Dedicated Plus</i>, <i>Fast Plus</i>, <i>Smart Plus</i>,
	<i>Strong Plus</i>, and <i>Tough Plus</i> will grant you a selection of two additional talents from the given class,
	but require that you cannot select more than one talent from a single talent tree. Currently it is not feasible within
	<strong>PCGen</strong> to limit the selection of talents granted by these feats. It will therefore be necessary for
	you to make sure to comply with these limits when making your selection.</p>

	<h1>Future - Robots</h1>

	<h2>Building Robots</h2>

	<p class="indent1">There are two sets of Robot races, one is meant for heroic characters run by Players, the other
	is meant for non-heroic characters. The races 4 named <strong>Biodroid (Medium</strong> and <Strong>Small)</strong> and
	<strong>Bioreplica (Medium</strong> and <strong>Small)</strong> are Player races and gain feats and skills when PC classes are
	gained as normal. The races whose names are formatted <strong>Robot(Type/Size)</strong> are all non-heroic,
	they do not gain feats or skill points as long as they are advanced in the <strong>Robot</strong> monster
	class, if given levels of an <i>Ordinary</i> base class they will not gain feats (unless equipped wih a
	<i>Feat Web</i>) but they will gain skill points, these should be discarded unless the Robot is
	equipped with a <i>Skill Web</i>.</p>

	<h2>Purchase DCs</h2>

	<p class="indent1">The purchase DC for a Robot is calculated and displayed in the special ability window. The
	purchase DC for some robotic equipment and accessories is not shown in the cost field but is
	instead displayed in the equipment's special property display. This is because the cost of many
	of these items are dependant on the cost of the Robot frame they are installed on, thus the
	purchase DC can be calculated but only after the item is equipped to the robot character. Items
	with straight purchase DCs are displayed in the cost field normally.</p>

	<h2>Equipment</h2>

	<p class="indent1">All the Robot equipment is meant only for Robots, the bonuses they have which provide the
	functionality are qualified as such and will not benefit characters who are not Robots.</p>

	<h2>Locomotion</h2>

	<p class="indent1">All Robots need to have some form of locomotion equipped to them to provide a movement
	speed. The speed can be increased by customizing the locomotion equipment and adding a
	speed upgrade. The rules say you cannot upgrade the speed past double its base speed but
	<strong>PCGen</strong> cannot enforce this.</p>

	<h2>Manipulators</h2>

	<p class="indent1">The Manipulators are size tiny and are meant for Medium-sized Robots. To get the proper
	damage for a Robot of another size you will need to customize the Manipulators for that Robot,
	they should be 2 size categories smaller than the Robot they will be installed on.</p>

	<h2>Skill Software</h2>

	<p class="indent1">The Skill software equipment all needs to be customized before you can add it to your character.
	This is so you can select the specific skills the equipment emulates.</p>

	<h2>Feat Software</h2>

	<p class="indent1">The Feat software could not be implemented the same way that skill software was. Each feat
	has a corresponding Robot Feat Software item which adds it as a virtual feat when the item is
	equipped. There are two sets of items relating to feat software, the actual devices, feat progit,
	feat net, and feat web and then there the individual feat software which grants the virtual
	feat. The software has no purchase DC but is assumed to come with the device when
	purchased. The Weapon Finesse and Weapon Focus feats are missing, as they couldn't be implemented that way.</p>
