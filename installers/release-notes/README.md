# PCGen

PCGen is a FREE Open Source character generator and maintenance program for role-playing games.

PCGen currently supports the d20 RPG system and includes data sets based upon gaming material from Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing and dozens of other publishers.
The project's current focus is on gaming material released under Wizards of the Coast's Open Gaming License (OGL) and sources supporting the Pathfinder RPG by Paizo, but the PCGen team also works with publishers to get permission to include limited Closed Content as well.
PCGen runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Unix/Linux using Java
