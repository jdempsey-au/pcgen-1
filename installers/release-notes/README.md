# What's new for v6.00.0 RC1

PCGen v6.00.0 RC1 is the first release candidate for PCGen 6.0. It represents a product we believe is 
ready for production use and which we would like your assistance in testing out. In particular the 
PCGen team would appreciate your feedback on importing your characters and data from earlier versions 
of PCGen. The highlights of the changes for PCGen 6.0 are listed below:
  
## Major Changes


* New user interface
	* A faster, more responsive GUI, particularly when using multiple characters.
	* A redesigned interface intended to be friendlier and more informative
	* Support for Java 7 and Open JDK
	* Faster startup time
* Improved performance
* Install to non admin location on Windows
* Full spell descriptions in RSRD and Pathfinder
* Command line PDF generation

## LST Changes:

* Choice tags revamped and rigorously parsed
* Choice tags now only provide a choice - a separate tag (e.g. BONUS) is used to apply the choice
* All shipped data has been run through the LST converter to bring it up to 6.0 standards
