What's new for v5.17.12
=======================

PCGen v5.17.12 continues to focus on the new user interface. We have a swathe of 
bug fixes, new features and general improvements for you. Some of the more noticeable 
changes are:

* Added kits support
* Revamped the Advanced Sources tab
* Description tab - Added notes functionality
* Reorganised menus

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but we still have to 
get the new familiars, companions, temporary mods, NPC generation and LST editor 
functionality completed. It is important to 
remember that this is an alpha in the industry standard sense and will have rough 
edges. We are putting it out for feedback but recommend you don't pick it up for 
your regular game use just yet.


Please give it a shot and let us know how it works for you.


We are also continuing on the behind the scenes work for the
[next big version](http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Release_6.0.x)/. We 
welcome your input, just comment on the wiki pages or post to the
[PCGen mailing list](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/).

[Release Notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/files/PCGen%20Unstable/5.17.12%20Alpha/pcgen-release-notes-51711.html/download) in the list above.
