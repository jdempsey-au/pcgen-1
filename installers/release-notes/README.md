What's new for v5.17.15
=======================

PCGen v5.17.15 continues to round out the new UI and stabilise the feature set 
as we head for a beta release soon. Some notable changes are:

* New Temporary Bonuses tab
* Choices are back on the Abilities tab
* Elemental wizards class bonuses to skills

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but will not 
initially support NPC generation and LST editor functionality.

We are almost done with the behind the scenes work for the 
[next big version](http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Release_6.0.x) too, 
we will soon be going to beta and then aiming for a new production release. We 
welcome your input, just comment on the wiki pages or post to the PCGen mailing 
list .

For full details of the new changes in this release, see the 
[Release Notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/files/PCGen%20Unstable/5.17.15%20Alpha/pcgen-release-notes-51715.html/download) in the list above.
