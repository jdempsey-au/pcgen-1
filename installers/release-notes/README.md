What's new for v5.17.14
=======================

PCGen v5.17.14 is primarily a big fix release. The most noticeable change is:

* Console Debugger - Variable Testing

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but does not currently 
support temporary mods, NPC generation and LST editor functionality. The new UI 
is getting more stable as we go. We appreciate your feedback - it is shaping the 
product.

New Sources

The following new sources were added in 5.17.14

* Pathfinder Chronicles - Dark Markets, A Guide to Katapesh
* [Unearthed Arcana] Paladin Variant Classes

We are also continuing on the behind the scenes work for the
