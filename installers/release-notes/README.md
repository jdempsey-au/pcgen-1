What's new for v5.17.13
=======================

PCGen v5.17.13 continues to focus on the new user interface. We have more 
bug fixes, new features and general improvements for you. Some of the more noticeable 
changes are:

* New companions tab
* Description tab now has many biography fields
* Table column widths are now remembered

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but we still have to 
get the new temporary mods, NPC generation and LST editor 
functionality completed. The new UI is getting more stable as we go. We 
appreciate your feedback - it is shaping the product.

We are also continuing on the behind the scenes work for the
[next big version](http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Release_6.0.x). We 
welcome your input, just comment on the wiki pages or post to the
[PCGen mailing list](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/).

[Release Notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/files/PCGen%20Unstable/5.17.13%20Alpha/pcgen-release-notes-51713.html/download) in the list above.
