# What's new for v5.17.18

PCGen v5.17.18 is our second beta in the lead-up to our 6.0 release. Thank-you for the fantastic feedback from the first beta - you've given us lots to work on! In the last 2 weeks we've addressed over 100 issues, bringing a huge improvement in stability for our new architecture and user interface in particular. 

A word about what a beta release is for the PCGen team. This is a build that has all of the new features that we plan shipping with v6.0. The beta cycle is where we focus on bug fixing and generally getting the program solid. An essential part of this is of course you trying it out and letting us know of any issues you find. Our trained monkeys are ready and waiting for your email to the PCGen mailing list!
