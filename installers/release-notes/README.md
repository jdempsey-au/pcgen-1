What's new for v5.17.16
=======================

PCGen v5.17.16 is our last alpha for this cycle! We are almost done with new 
additions to the new UI and expect to head for a beta release in the next week 
or two. Some notable changes are:

* New, improved choosers in most locations
* Pop-up context menu on the purchase tab for buying or selling multiple items

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but will not 
initially support NPC generation and LST editor functionality.

We are almost done with the behind the scenes work for the 
[next big version](http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Release_6.0.x) too, 
we will soon be going to beta and then aiming for a new production release. We 
welcome your input, just comment on the wiki pages or post to the PCGen mailing 
list .

For full details of the new changes in this release, see the 
[Release Notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcgen/files/PCGen%20Unstable/5.17.16%20Alpha/pcgen-release-notes-51716.html/download) in the list above.
