What's new for v5.17.11
=======================

PCGen v5.17.11 is an alpha release with a difference. This time we introduce 
for the first time our new user interface!

The new user interface does most of what you are used to, but we still have to 
get kits, familiars, companions and temporary mods working. It is important to 
remember that this is an alpha in the industry standard sense and will have 
rough edges. We are putting it out for feedback but recommend you don't pick it 
up for your regular game use just yet. 

New User Interface
------------------
So what do you get with this new user interface?

* A faster, more responsive GUI, particularly when using multiple characters.
* A redesigned interface intended to be friendlier and more informative
* Support for Java 7 and Open JDK
* Faster startup time

While the general layout of the program will still be familiar we've made lots 
of enhancements along the way such as

* More information on the summary page for a quick view of the character
* Easier access to new character tasks such as choosing an ability score method
* Active 'things to do' list - click on a task and you'll be taken to the screen and field.
* Start your character with class first - alignment is back to an after thought
* Toggle quick filtering buttons to quickly focus on relevant items
* A location based equipping display supporting drag and drop.
* Thumbnail selection from your character portrait.
* A campaign history tracker
* Improved command line use, including PDF generation.
* Improved printing including an in-program print preview.
* Easier exporting, including auto open your generated file.

Please give it a shot and let us know how it works for you.
