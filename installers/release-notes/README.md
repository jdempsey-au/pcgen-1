# What's new for v5.17.17

Welcome to our first beta for the 6.0 cycle! Its been a bit longer then we were expecting, but we think it is worth the wait. We've been hard at work and fixed a slew of bugs, added some great new features and generally been getting everything into shape for release.

A word about what a beta release is for the PCGen team. This is a build that has all of the new features that we plan shipping with v6.0. The beta cycle is where we focus on bug fixing and generally getting the program solid. An essential part of this is of course you trying it out and letting us know of any issues you find. Our trained monkeys are ready and waiting for your email to the PCGen mailing list!
