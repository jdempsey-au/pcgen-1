# What's new for v5.17.19

PCGen v5.17.19 is our third beta in the lead-up to our 6.0 release. We've continued to squash bugs and improve the stability of PCGen. Thanks again for the great feedback and reports of issues!

A word about what a beta release is for the PCGen team. This is a build that has all of the new features that we plan shipping with v6.0. The beta cycle is where we focus on bug fixing and generally getting the program solid. An essential part of this is of course you trying it out and letting us know of any issues you find. Our trained monkeys are ready and waiting for your email to the PCGen mailing list!

In particular it would be great to get your feedback and issue reports on the Ultimate Magic and Ultimate Combat sources we added last time. Also, now would be a great time to try out your old characters and custom sources and let us know if there any problems.
